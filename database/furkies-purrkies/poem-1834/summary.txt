Use Jogging To Understand Bodybuilding
Sunday • March 9th 2025 • 9:24:52 pm

Jogger wisdom dictates,
that it is not a real jog…

Until you can run straight through,
without the need to stop.

This is the process of,
gradually building up your endurance.

One of the things that happens,
is growing more muscle.

Now, once you are able to run,
straight through.

Instead of trying to go faster,
get a pair of light dumbbells.

Maybe 3 pounds per hand,
5 can be pretty crushing at first.

You are adding 10 pounds,
to your challenge, that is a lot.

Even later on,
when you are lifting 20 lb. per hand.

You should still move up,
only by about 2.5 pounds.

So don’t jump from 15 to 20 per hand,
fo to 17.5 first, and then get to your 20.

But this is actually something,
that you will figure out on your own.

Precisely,
because of jogger wisdom.

You will know
from building up your endurance.

How quickly the human body adapts,
how you have to move little by little.

And how rest, does not help,
it should be eliminated with endurance.

---

I know it seems weird,
that you start bodybuilding by jogging.

But, unlike a jogger,
the moment you run straight through.

You then weight you body down,
to induce more adaptation.

Eventually,
jogging becomes too hard.

And that is when you go,
into the gym, and walk, twist and turn.

Here you can add an extra hour,
slow down your songs.

Until your body adapts to higher weights,
and then either up the tempo.

Or up the weights,
tempo burn fat, weights build muscle.

---

You should start with light dumbbells,
but not so light that you can lift more.

And never so heavy,
that you are forced to stop.

---

To grow muscle,
you must workout long, not heavy.

---

Heads up,
if you start in the middle of the dumbbell rack.

You will not be able to lift for long enough,
and never really increase your weight by much.

By not lifting for long enough,
your body does not adapt very much.

And what you can accomplish in 12 months,
now turns to 10 years.

As you are just not challenging your body,
enough, for fast and reliable adaptation.

---

Standing dumbbells exercises,
are a full body exercise.

So as long as you jog a bit,
and walk, and twist, turn and dance.

You are working on so many muscles,
that other exercises can only slow you down.

Again, yet another wisdom,
that you will learn on your own,

From that initial,
jogging with light dumbbells.

Lastly just like jogging,
exercise is 5 days a week.

But you start slow,
and get your body used to it.

---

You will see huge muscles,
from just hogging though.

You can probably handle,
10lb per hand, and a slow jog.

But that is the area,
where you head for the gym.

And add lifting above your head,
and to the side, and in front.

Creating a safe,
and powerful full body workout.
