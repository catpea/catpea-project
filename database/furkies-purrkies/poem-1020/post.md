Across your entire history,
the gym is likely to call to you, twice, or thrice.

Honor the opportunity,
there is no clearer representation of crossroads.

---

Don’t divide things up,
it won’t work.

If you think you can just learn to come in every day,
then learn to lift the weights, you are not coming back.

Be careful, you have already come under an attack,
bullies tricked you into being ashamed of lifting light weights correctly.

And into swinging heavy weights,
which does nothing.

---

Now let me explain, why you think you can’t,
and help to fix your swinging-of-weights.

---

You think you can’t, because nobody can just brainlessly lift weights,
there is something non-woo-woo bullshit.

That you first have to activate in your mind,
you have to enter a dance like trance.

And techno, bubble gum pop, and shuffle dance music,
will do that for you.

Working out without workout music
is like  asking non-professional players…

To play whatever their game,
with their other hand – that does not have the muscle memory.

Working out without the trance of music,
is like writing letters with your non-dominant hand – JUST DON’T DO IT.

If your battery dies, go home, and charge the damn thing,
the gym music does not work to trigger the warrior trance.

I always carry a backup music device,
because I know that I will not be able to do anything without those songs.

The trance, combined with starting with light weight,
builds the endurance, that will within months trigger muscle growth.

---

You can’t just listen to any songs,
or lift beginner weights that are too lights.

Listen to me, listen carefully,
the song has to be blissfully interesting.

And at a tempo where you can hit every beat,
which is to say, one beat to lift, one to lower.

Synchronizing your motion to the beat,
is how you sustain the damn trance.

And there is more,
you need headphones that can deliver bass.

Search for “TFCard Headphones”,
that should help you discover a range of $20-$30 dollar over-the-ear mp3 player headphones.

---

Do you understand what I am saying,
working out without bass boosted pretty songs that you in a warrior trance.

Is not possible, so build up a playlist,
start by searching for Cutting Shapes or Shuffle Dance music.

Energetic these songs are rare,
and only last a couple of weeks.

Then start dragging you down, and start boring you,
if you fight it, you will permanently deplete the song of workout trance.

You need to keep up your song search,
this is why looking at a type of energetic dance is useful.

---

You may have some luck with Electro-swing,
and HIIT workout music.

Which stands for High Intensity Interval Training,
if you still have a hard time get a wearable interval time or an app.

A good slower starting song is “Alone by Alan Walker”,
and also try “Dance Monkey by Tones And I”, and “Friendships by Pascal Letoublon”

---

Now, lifting light weights,
is the same as swinging heaving weights.

The rule of thumb is, you can only rest for 25 seconds at most,
and that is the exception…

You only rest the few seconds that it takes you,
to take your gloves off and switch to a better song.

---

The people who laugh at you for wearing gloves,
the morons who ask if you have a matching purse…

Are the bullies,
they are there to shame you away, so that they don’t have to try.

---

You start with the beginner weight,
that makes your arms tired after two minutes of lifting.

And when you feel you need to stop,
you simply, beautifully, and respectfully, to all your new nature…

Go to a lower weight,
and never stop.
