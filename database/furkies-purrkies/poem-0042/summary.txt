I Miss Old Programming Languages
Wednesday • April 22nd 2020 • 9:46:11 pm

Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Seven.

I can't believe that seven only rhymes with Eleven, and Heaven.

Every ten days I get stuck rhyming those two words,

and it is just about as fun as petting birds.

I was writing [Bash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hz7-v2f1sA) this afternoon,

I am so full of energy, I feel like a loon.

I was so tired at eight yesterday,

I have no idea how I will fall asleep today.

I wrote a [non-capturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW4CdejMNPA) Perl [Regular Expression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykSuHWhh5hc) in [sed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32waL1Z9XK0),

gosh I miss the old [Perl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2JJZVqe97I), I miss [CGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zx1vEmaQMc), and I miss [ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYpmLH6IjQ).

What has the world become after [abandoning modes](https://youtu.be/PUv66718DII?t=2490),

and how strange have become our codes.

Using [SASS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St5B7hnMLjg) writ in [C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJkB_Tggk8U),

to make [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78)? What a mess!

And beyond that, with [async/await](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoRJizFvM7s),

[JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A_jkh2AKR8) has become a heavy weight.

I always tell people if you make for the web,

use the [language, of the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGvA92h9IbU).

They then look at me accusingly,

parading [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Tko2YC5hA), [PHP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBL9Athx7ms) or [Dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KlnlCq2M5Q), maybe [Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xa3Y4xz8_s)?! amusingly.

Come on people, this is not our first rodeo,

Time took out Perl with a torpedo.

This is war, and those who fall behind lose,

If you write for the web, use the [language, of the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGvA92h9IbU).

Your utilities will hang around longer,

and your accomplishments will be that much stronger.
