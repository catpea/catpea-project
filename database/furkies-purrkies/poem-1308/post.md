We have to explain to the students,
why we are tolerating indoctrination.

Why are we tolerating colleges,
not only robbing everyone of their savings and earnings.

But also forcing students,
to take out loans, that cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy.

Permanent loans,
life long debt, most of which is interest.

We owe an explanation, because we know schools are not working,
that it is just a dog an pony memorization show.

Why are children inheriting,
their parents poverty.

What have they done to us,
to begin at such a disadvantage?

Because those who are stuck in poverty,
will not be able to become brilliant thinkers.

They will be too scared of homelessness and hunger,
of dying in the streets…

To become the brilliant beings,
that they really are.

There is so much unfinished work,
so much corruption, so many lies.

So much reliance on indoctrination,
to enslave beautiful minds with trickery.

That we can say,
not a damn thing has changed…

Since Socrates was murdered
for teaching his students how exit state or religious indoctrination.

Therefore, your place in the Universe,
for now, is to begin where the Philosophers left off.

To continue their work,
to create a legacy where others can begin where you leave off.

The World, Humanity, and the future generations need your help,
even Earth needs your help.

You are charged with growing all the way up,
until you become a great being, and leave a positive and lasting legacy.

You have to make room in your mind,
or go to a real school, if you want to look at it that way.

And set off to cross the Appalachian, Pacific Crest,
and Continental divide…

While listening to non-fiction narrated books,
written by clear thinking intellectuals, who left, or will leave a worthy legacy.

You can’t have a career, when the younger generations,
are showed into fake education so that the teachers and staff can make a buck.

So that these men who sold the world, can bellow in laughter,
whilst croaking:

The dunces are beyond all help,
and the geniuses will help themselves.

Working hard, is nowhere nearly enough for the younger generations,
they need your wisdom, they demand a wise perspective.

So that they don’t end up as victims of indoctrination,
servants, soldiers, workers, all waiting for Wednesday, or worse.

They need a clear and present example,
of powerful great beings.

Not hard workers, the time for, “Hello teacher, what my lesson”, is over,
you got tricked out of real education.

You got tricked into thinking that your GPA defined you,
and that books were just too hard for you to read.

But your GPA was fixed,
to keep the teacher under radar.

And the reason why you couldn't read books,
is because stress makes indoctrination stick better.

---

Before you set off for your career,
you have to explain to the younger generations why you go tricked by school.

And why do you expect them,
to go through the same.

---

Take to the trails, start at Walden Pond if you can,
and examine your life, learn to know thyself.

So that not until time comes to die,
do you realize, that you have never lived at all.

And then rise, grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

Because "until you become a great being",
is all the future has right now.
