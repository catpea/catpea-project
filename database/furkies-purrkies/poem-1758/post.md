But empowerment,
is not what you want it to be.

If you treat it as such, the men who sold the world,
will now try to sell you empowerment.

And that is how you have lost education...
you memorized, because it was easier than comprehension.

And shallow mockery of education is precisely,
what even brand name universes sell today.

The results, have now become a mockery of reality,
where fantasies and lies trump wisdom, fact and science.

---

Empowerment is not a chant, or a sticker, or an attitude,
it is nether a YOLO, or the equally useless now GPA 4.0.

You cannot buy it, and get a matching license place to parade it,
and you will not find outsideof yourself.

---

Empowerment is your second and likely final chance at authentic education,
and it demands personalized instruction from a machine.

It is a curiosity driven education,
that will crisscross subjects countless many times.

But this time in context, of something that matters,
where memorization is non-sense.

---

At first Artificial Intelligence will feel shallow,
as surface questions is all you will know.

Though overlapping surfaces are a fountainhead of knowledge,
and there is nothing shallow about the search for your next curiosity.

---

This is where narrated books,
will serve to ignite your curiosities.

[Demon Haunted World][1] and [A Short History of Nearly Everything][2],
will gently introduce you to discovering the universe around you.

And the [Giants of Philosophy][3], will show you where we have begun,
not as unhinged power hungry liars, but as great beings.

These are your first thee books, re-listen to them for more and comfort,
you will inherit their vocabulary, curiosity, wisdom, class, and culture.

That you have the ability, to listen to books,
and speak with machines, is unprecedented.

You are finally free to learn in your own sequence,
at your own pace, and in harmony with your curiosities.

You should never forgive for having your views warped,
so that you play some role, in somebody elseâ€™s low effort game.

Fool you once, shame on the men who sold the world;
but fool you twice, is never allowed.

Empowerment means powerful self education,
with meaningful results.

Lack of authentic and meaningful education, is humanity's only weakness,
please, counter your opponents move, before it is even made.

The victorious win first and then go to war,
the defeated go to war merely hoping win.

Become an artist, a genius, a polymath,
rise to stand as a great being so that others can find their way too.
