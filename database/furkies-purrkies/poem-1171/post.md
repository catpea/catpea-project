Philosophy is a mind multiplier, it will help you meet your elder self,
and your projection will help you understand what their regrets are.

Your elder self is such a certainty, that you can even ask them to keep you company,
and they will come sit with you, and eventually when you are the right age...

You will venture back, in your thoughts with a smile,
to keep the promise you made to your younger self.

Plus there is a reminder,
that I describe at the end of this poem as to go easy at first.

The reason Philosophy has been called the Mother of Sciences,
is because the act of questioning and observation help us see in profound ways.

Normally, nobody complains about religion, everybody loves getting diplomas,
and who want to proudly work hard for a paycheck.

To a degree, a young species, could tolerate these ideas,
for a generation or two, as a stepping stone.

But the challenges of leadership, hope, authenticity and progress,
and the ease with which liars can devastate entire generations…

Creates an illusion, where it seems like humanity can stand still,
have a war from time to time, and that poverty is a fact of life.

It will help you notice that religions are invented, out of comfort,
and that there isn’t a right one, as that only depends where and when we are born.

It can help you see that the concept of standardized education,
is an impossible and destructive idea, that can be quickly turned against a nation.

You may even notice, though this is a hard one,
that the reason that we use the term Academic Philosophy…

As opposed to just plain philosophy, is because academic philosophy,
is meant to teach what to think.

And plain philosophy, just the ordinary, common, unrestricted kind,
is all about learning how to think.

And, it can help you notice or independently reinvent,
the concept of wage slavery and see how mandatory social credit…

That makes so much sense, to some,
will swiftly turn it into the real thing.

See, philosophy, or the simple art of questioning everything,
of independently verifying what others term a fact…

is a way, for you, yourself, to by your own hand, pull wisdom, out of the universe,
out of starry nights, beautifully fragrant summer days, and snowy adventures.

Philosophy is a way for Humanity to remember where it is going,
for Humans to remember that they are born Noble with Dignity.

Philosophy is a map of the cities that we are to build,
of the mountains and heights that you are to reach…

It is also a compass towards a central meeting place for all that have been misled,
a point where all cultures converge in peace and wisdom, and laughter; and greatness.

Philosophy, is a program that is encoded in all thinking creatures,
when starting this program, we get a much needed operating system upgrade.

---

Finally, Philosophy will help you understand,
that you can only ever find your meaning...

When you set of on a quest of Knowledge and Wisdom,
in search of Greatness.

Your path towards becoming a great being,
does not end with a reward...

Rather, your greatness will simply ensure,
from all the things that you will do.
