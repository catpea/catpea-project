**[Softly, like a nursery rhyme]**
Hush little darling, hush right now,
Mama’s going to highs school.
Notebook packed and laces tight,
She’s off to learn what’s wrong and right.

**[Shift — a German steady beat, march tempo begins]**
Left—right—left—right—march through the gate,
Mama is early, Papa is late.
Eyes like thunder, jawline firm,
This time its for a *real* long term.

**Refrain:**
*March, march, parents learn again,*
*Truth and reason, paper and pen.*
*No more guessing, no more slide,*
*We’re taking knowledge back with pride.*

They open the books that once were closed,
Equations bloom, the grammar glows.
History’s wounds, they read them clear,
Not watered down, not shaped by fear.

**Refrain (stronger):**
*March, march, parents learn again,*
*Truth and reason, paper and pen.*
*Things are going to change around here,*
*The age of hollow grades ends this year.*

Chalk dust rises like battle smoke,
Mama won’t laugh at the teacher’s joke.
No more “good job” for half a try,
She wants the *why*, she wants the *why!*

Lunch bell rings — but they don’t go,
They’re writing essays, row by row.
Dad’s reciting Newton’s laws,
Mama’s quoting civil cause.

**Bridge (slower, heavy drums):**
Because memorization’s not education,
And smiling grades were cheap salvation.
Now the parents take a stand—
Learning justice hand in hand.

**Final Refrain (anthemic):**
*March, march, parents learn again,*
*Truth and reason, paper and pen.*
*Currents change, the world’s awake,*
*No more dreams that schools can fake.*

**[Crescendo – last stanza, reform tone]**
Now lawmakers line up next,
Clipboards ready, slightly vexed.
The *new* high schools are waiting still —
Tests are mandatory… and *real*.

**[Soft echo, returning to lullaby]**
Hush little darling, hush, don’t cry—
Mama’s making learning fly.
When truth returns to every rule,
We all go back… to a better school.
