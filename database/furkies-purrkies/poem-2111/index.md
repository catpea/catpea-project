Ultramarathon runners show that there is no such thing as muscle failure,
there maybe lack of endurance, or cutting off circulation but not failure.

---

Does it seem right to you, to pick weight that are so heavy,
that one can only lift them for 20 to 60 seconds, and then sit.

What if we lowered weights to those we can actually lift,
and lifted them for 20 minutes not 20 seconds.

Wouldn’t that?
have a greater impact on muscle growth?

---

And could it be that cutting off circulation with weights that are too heavy,
actually prevents the development of muscle?

Does it not seem odd, to cut off circulation,
especially during exercise, that depends on it?

What if instead of cutting of circulation we released the build up,
by switching to a complementary exercise that works a different muscle group?

---

What if instead, we earned an hour of minimal dancing endurance,
and performed standing dumbbell exercises whilst twisting and turning?

Lifting light, but not so light that we can lift more,
and never so heavy that we must stop for more than a few seconds.

Only mixing in heavier dumbbells or moving up in weight,
when out body adapted?

---


Does it not seem odd that everyone is sitting at the gym,
when we know from our early days as babies, that motion grows muscles?

Wouldn't the elderly benefit more from walking around with 3lb dumbbells,
than sitting in machines that seem to be designed for those who can’t walk.

What would happen to a baby that would only use machines,
would they develop in a healthy way, or become deformed?

---

Does it not seem,
that the gym is a place where we just simulate a workout.

That a real workout is an outdoor workout,
maybe [hiking, or jogging][1] or even [dancing with dumbbells is better][2]?

A gym being a warm place, for cold or rainy days,
rather than where we set root.

Even the initial earning of endurance for bodybuilding,
would benefit from being a mix of hiking, jogging, and dancing.

---

Could it be that the most effective workout is 1980s aerobics,
and that bodybuilding is aerobics weighted down.

Where we can’t move or dance as fast,
but it is still a dance with dumbbells light enough, not to stop us?

---

Doesn’t it seem that weighted aerobics could grow muscle in months,
like when we have a cast and out legs becomes skinny,

And that cutting of circulation, commonly known as muscle failure,
only slows down muscle development to a crawl?

How would your recently healed leg grow back its muscle,
if you crushed it with heavy weights, sat and cut off circulation all the time.

---

I am just asking, wondering, if what we do at the gym,
is the opposite of what we should be doing, that’s all.
