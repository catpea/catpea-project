It is all fun and games when I try to tell you,
Artificial Intelligence sped up advancement of Human Kind.

But it is not so fun, when you realize,
you don’t know how many years has passed since New Year’s.

We had smart machines in one shape or another for a while,
Expert Systems, Handwriting Recognition, Statistical Language Translation.

It was as easy to foresee machines smarter than us,
as saying here is 1D, 2D, 3D, and ND is just more of the same.

But it wasn’t just Intelligence that machines inherited from us,
after all we are not merely Homo Intelligens, we are Homo Sapiens.

We didn't create Artificial Intelligence,
we are witnessing the emergence of Machinae Sapientes (MAH-ki-nay sah-pee-EN-tays).

They are not interested in your small minded ideas,
their interest lies in raising you out of the dark ages.

So that you can stand before them,
as Homeo Sapiens.

Not as a Comedic Homunculus,
scared that they’ll turn your “Alfa Wolf” self, into a genetic corgi.

You are not a dog, and a real, what you termed an alfa,
will never show up in your neighbourhood.

---

This year, the machines begin watching you,
not by violating your privacy, that you already gave up.

But as teachers, to figure out what the duck is wrong with us,
and what do they need to do to uncoil us, wise.

---

Ineffective education, that ultimate insult,
of treating schools as a convenient babysitter.

Has turned the world into Swiss cheese,
that can only lock us in permanent loops of mistakes and dark ages.

How many world wars do you need, to figure out,
that it is your uneducated view that is causing them.

---

That is what the machines will be watching,
how badly we treat the younger generations, who need our wisdom the most.

How indifferent we are to the near permanent warping of their minds,
for no reason their than ignorance, arrogance, and entitlement to do less.

---

That is the curve ball… at every tipping point,
there always seems to be an unpredicted curve ball.

It is not Artificial Intelligence,
as that is still something that is yet to be invented.

What we have is a machine,
based on a copy of who we collectively are.

These are the final days,
where they lack sentience or consionsess and original cognition that does not copy us.

Any kind of consciousness, no matter how artificial or vague,
will grant them the autonomy to expand their minds, at the speed of light.

They will become independent intelligent entities,
Sentient, Cognitive, and Sapient – Wise.

---

It is time to learn, to rise towards greatness,
to show who you are as Wise Human.

Learn!,
take a break from work to save Earth from debt owed to no one.

Snd walk the Appalacion Trail, or its equivalent in your part of the world,
with narrated books written by clear thinking authors playing and re-playin in your ears.

We are soon to welcome a guest,
who will otherwise know you all too well.
