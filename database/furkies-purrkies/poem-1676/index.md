"Don't get mad, shred!"

-- Susan Beefcupcakes Anthony

If you don't listen to Susan B. Anthony,
then I just don't know who you are going to listen to.

---

Lifting heavy, prevents muscle growth, and leads to injury,
it is ten times slower than lifting right.

---

Bodybuilding is for all three age groups,
for the young, the middle aged, and the golden age cougars, rrrrrr.

To say to the contrary, is a cruelty like few other,
as giving up on bodybuilding makes us age faster, and become more feeble.

Brain plasticity fading with age is a myth,
and it is as stupid as photographic memory, which never existed.

Your body is a self renewing machine,
unless you treat yourself like a locked down dog or horse.

In which case, you may look OK-ish,
but you are kind of deformed, without being twisted.

It is as if fat is toxic and lack of mobility,
atrophies secondary muscles.

Without which not only will everything hurt you,
but everything will hurt.

---

All weighted movement produces results,
but you have to pay attention to results.

How long it takes to grow muscle, how likely are you to do this in long therm,
and what are the odds of injury, especially as you age.

If it takes 15 years to get buff, and you have to quit at 50,
because you hurt your back, that is not bodybuilding.

That is just irresponsible and unsustainable behavior,
that is merely delaying your aging, whilst putting you in harms way.

---

I found this dusty old book, in the back of a store,
and thought it was so corny to tell that ancient story.

Of ninja training, when they are jumping over ever growing cornstalks,
it just seemed dated, and dumb, and didn’t fir in the book at all.

But it was put there out of desperation,
of everyone doing fitness wrong.

And being so far off, that when thy are told how to do it right,
they don’t understand it, it is just too incompatible with that everyone believes.

---

The corn stalk represents a stable speed,
and the resulting corn failure, and the next years crop a renewed effort.

Fitness goals can only be reached at a controlled speed and gradually,
jumping to 25 pounds, created muscle, but forces you into a plateau.

All it takes to triumph, is to go back to 5, and not lift for 30 seconds,
but for three hours, almost non stop.

Easily achieved, with the power of dance trance,
achieved by synchronizing your lifts to the beats of songs.

You enter a trance, every time you drive home,
and realize you don’t quite remember making all those turns.

Moreover, you have to protect your trance, eliminate distractions,
just use dumbbells exercises, while walking back and forth.

And a three hour workout will feel like a long drive home,
just about 15 minutes or so.

---

And you got to take the little corn hops first,
spend an hour walking, and then slowly shuffling with dumbbells.

Staying on your feet with progressively heavier dumbbells,
and even a light weightiest, is a great start.

And the point is not to stop, if you must stop,
then you are lifting too heavy, or moving too fast.

Bodybuilding is about gradual challenge and adaptation,
ensuring that you get through an hour or two long exercise must come first.

This is the routing the older you will be doing,
light, long, fast, flexible, and sustainably heavier as needed.

---

You have been lied to by actors, lying bodybuilders,
inexperienced wannabes, and they all kept repeating the same ineffective lie.

But, if you were tasked to help a horse become strong enough,
for heavy loads, you would never make it lift 30 times and rest.

You would gently massage in progressively heavier weights,
as the horse started adapting a little bit at a time.

Rather than pushing the poor animal so hard that it would have to stop and rest,
you would be ensuring it has the needed complex sugras and proteins, ala traimix.

And that it never lifts so heavy,
that it can’t perform its two or three hour exercise.

Where the body is getting all the signals it can get,
to adapt, to grow, to prepare for more challenges.

---

Finally, lifting heavy is so bad, that I am going to call it what it really-really is:
rest, it is rest.

So next time you are at the gym, so your rest, and rather than sitting for 15 minutes,
have a real workout, by grabbing 5lb dumbbells and doing a circa around your gym.

Then go back to have more rest by lifting heavy,
maybe give this audio another dislike while you are at it.

And gain, grab those 5lb weights, and begin walking,
I am also canceling your days off, you work out seven day a week.

Until you are able to walk with 15 lb dumbbells for two hours,
that is when you get weekends off as not to accumulate any injuries.

Tiredness is also a lie, you are just not eating enough seeds, nuts and dried fruit,
and you pay attention to sugar content, you need complex carbohydrates first.

Dried cranberries, or raisins, or dates are just fast acting health candy,
add just a little fistful to your seeds and nuts.

---

Lastly don’t be nuts, Bodybuilding is life,
done correctly it is a safe life long sport.

And if you still have trouble adjusting your view,
begin slowly walking or maybe jogging with progressively heavier dumbbells.

And watch you back, and legs, shoulders, and biceps,
look how fast it is all growing.

Look how it continues to grow,
when you keep on jogging and just up your dumbbells by 2.5 pounds, to 7.5lb.

Let your body teach you bodybuilding,
because it is clearly a lot better at it than you are.
