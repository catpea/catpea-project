Don’t Let Teachers Scare Or Trick You Into Memorization
Tuesday • September 6th 2022 • 9:40:04 pm

Let me be very clear about this,\
while it is not a conspiracy, you didn't choose cramming, you were manipulated into it.

Let me show you what you are up against, and how impossible it seems,\
the notion of pre-requisite classes is mostly about getting you to brainlessly memorize.

No one sat down to invent it this way,\
it is just that over time teachers settled into it, because it worked out well for them.

The way you see the truth in this, is by asking yourself,\
what the heck is a school anyway - you have to back all the way out...

And ask if the invention of school should have a mechanism,\
that will force students into memorization, cramming, and pretending to learn.

Do we we want to cut students off,\
deny them access to knowledge, to lectures, because they don't know something.

Do people learn in an order dictated by standards,\
and should they fail if they take too long.

Should we put them in rows,\
and cut lectures off at a precise time.

You see, the entire organization of school,\
serves the teachers.

And they serve you,\
with easy to memorize disconnected facts.

Pre-requisites, or classes that ASSUME, you memorized other classes,\
are just pluming that pass you along for a paycheck.

And don't ask how classes could possibly work,\
if there was a mix of people with different levels of knowledge.

People always have different knowledge,\
we all have unique talents and curiosities.

You see, it isn't just pre-requisites,\
but the damn classrooms, and the timed lecture, and sitting in rows that is all a theater.

They are forcing you to memorize,\
what will be on state tests - so that they can keep accreditation, and keep getting paid.

The common art teacher, with watercolors in hand,\
does not ask questions, they just do their job.

And that would be fine, if their actions didn't impact anybody else,\
they wouldn't be hurting anybody.

Not asking questions is the way fraud happens,\
talk about teaching critical thinking.

They have threatened you with bad grades, bad GPA,\
being held back and permanently marked as delayed, and threatened your career.

And they are giving you material so bad, under the worst possible circumstances,\
in order to process you like a sausage, for a paycheck.

Memorization is a gu...

... harm they have caused.

Within two hours, you can be [composing your own music with LMMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU), the good stuff in music, is the simple stuff.

Sampling, getting a neat chord and melody, a bit of reverb,\
and in the first ten minutes, you make a cool song. Ten minutes.

This is so good, that any mention of the music theory in High School,\
almost seems like fraud - invent your own theory.

The notes are just sound frequencies, invent you own scale,\
or don't worry about it at all, just compose.

Did you figure out that you can use the [projector above your head in art class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZKUKCnkZ6E),\
to beam your selfies, or friend photos, on a canvas and skip over the line drawing part, and just get to the part where you are swimming in color.

Do you understand how many artists gave up,\
because they though they couldn't draw.

Faking art instruction, and preventing people from becoming artists,\
is a crime on a level that we can't grasp.

All for what, to look like they are teaching,\
to make it seem like your Quasimodo portraits are getting there.

Just a couple more semesters,\
and you'll get it.

Get what?\
Graduation poverty, disenchantment, get far away enough, so that you can spot the fraud.

[Digital Art is even better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uCH2z_zLmc) than a projector,\
Hyper-realistic Painting are your first step.

Did you know that your real problem in art, is control,\
you have the power to rebuild reality, teachers, politician, dictators, are yours to reshape to show who they are.

You learn math from Generative Art, Physics from Drones and 2D Game Engines,\
profound and dense Literature from Hiking and Camping...

Where you make a point of having no less than five hefty study guides,\
to spoil the damn story, so that you get the full picture.

---

Everyone one of your curiosities,\
has three more tucked behind it.

As you grow, you will discover that you want to grow all the way up,\
that your Knowledge and Wisdom will be enough to keep together as a Great Being.

In the absence of teachers you become the teacher,\
in the absence of real schools, you need to self educate, and build them.

For the world,\
for a more authentic future.
