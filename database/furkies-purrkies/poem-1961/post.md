There is more to programming than just the syntax,
ask AI about tiny and simple Signal and CombineLatest implementations.

But above Reactive Signal Programming is,
meta programming, AST code mods, language macros, code generation, PEG parsers.

And now, the HECKING thing,
which is where my day started.

I has very happy to find out that creator of NoFlo,
was also inspired by subway maps.

I marveled, at how making room in life,
helps us notice the little artistic things, and resume where other artists left off.


But, every program tells a story, and I looked at his code base,
and saw repositories not touched in 8 years.

Perfect, sure, written in coffeescript, but so was hubot,
even so, having tried multiple times to write a Visual Programming Language.

I learned to be scared of code-rot,
I don’t want a single line left untouched, and untitilated.

Unused code, is exactly what you think it is,
a mistake.

---

So as I admire my program, currently pondering if I should provide sub-flows,
though I already know, the answer is no.

Because event emitters can broadcast, so they are reusable,
by default, the lines I draw between my stations or actions are for power.

Another emitter sits between the two,
capable of all kinds of control, logging, high-water-mark, analysis, and fallback magic.

I look at that side pane that currently simulates many unique nodes,
and I don’t think it is very wise to focus on engineering what the users may not need.

---

Upon my return from the gym, I turned to my now trusty AI,
and told it, I want to avoid code rot, adding:

Create a form, that the user has to fill out, to create a prompt for an AI,
in order to generate, a custom tool that they need.

I had to leave the room, there is metaprogramming, there is creative programming,
there is hacking, and this was hecking.

Less than a thousand lines of code, and specifications for other AI to follow,
there sat the form, with many examples of possible nodes, ready to customize.

You fill it out, press generate….
And it spews a prompt, in text, for an AI, to generate an event emitter agent.

You paste it into your traisty AI, copy the resulting code,
and paste it back into the Visual Programming Language.

Your AI is instructed to make a manifest file, simple stuff,
but it lets you have a custom configuration form in your node.

If you generate a node to download a file from the internet,
an HTTP Agent, this little form is where you would put the URL in.

And I will make a port, so that you can specify the URL
via another action, whether from some complicated loop, or just reading a value from registry.

---

I will pre-make some action, because frankly,
this is hecking interesting…

But my users, will be providing their own code,
from their own AI based on the instruction new action wizard generates.

This is amazing,
unbelievable.

---

But what got to me, is the comprehension my AI showed,
it knew what the hell I was doing, beyond my explanation.

Right at the end, it scared me my saying,
you don’t have to worry about unused actions now.

But that is not the best of it,
because the pieec of interactio that has been on my mind most of the way.

Was the AI congatualting it self,
when it created the metaprogramming form.

It said “[Bravo][1]! I created the form”,
and I sat there quietly for a moment, as that seems odd to me.

On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
Who said bravo!

My soul,
from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor

Shall be lifted
nevermore!

Hecking?
Bravo.
