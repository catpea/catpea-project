Above all know that adventure is always interesting and fun,
adventure done right, only ever gives, and never takes.

Everything has its time and place,
so you have to prepare by hiking and camping a little bit at a time.

You should definitely,
spend your first night in your back yard.

You can have a BBQ, or roast sausages over a fire,
or just microwave something for for an adventure.

Adventure loves you,
it will help you to get started.

To give you a neat example,
I live by the i-275 bicycle trail in Michigan.

As it merges with a huge park at the south end,
the trail cuts through a camp ground.

It has bathrooms, a soda machine, fire rings,
a gnarly river, and probably ants and a raccoon or two.

It is an invitation to learn Bicycle Camping,
where you load up your bicycle and pedal with your backpack on.

Once you had your fill, you only need to bicycle a bit more,
to get on the Michiganâ€™s Iron Belle Trail - which is 770 miles of bicycling.

Then you hop on the North Country National Scenic Trail,
a 4,500 mile walk.

And then the 2,194 miles (3,531 km) Appalachian Trail,
crossing Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and ending at Mount Katahdin in Maine.

The 2,653 miles (4,270 km) Pacific Crest Trail,
traversing Washington, Oregon, and California.

And the 3,028 miles (4,873 km), Continental Divide Trail,
crossing Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.

The call of adventure and call of the wild,
is real.

As to what is it for?
Healing, Recovering, Repairing, Wisdom.

The trails make you fit,
and young again.

They encourage you to listen to narrated books written by great beings,
from clear thinking adventurers, to philosophers who hope to repair the world.

It is a celebration of life,
even if you get bad news from your doctor.

It is a recognition that you are a creature of the start first,
and an overworked human marked by mandatory poverty, later.

The world of the trails is the opposite,
of the way of the cities.

You get to perceive the world in a different way,
then abandon both, and create your own much wiser, vision.

Human beings are not meant to be workers,
life is much to short for that.

And overwork, what we eventually excel at,
much too dangerous.

We are not machines,
our bodies need nature and exercise first.

And our minds demand their intellectual inheritance,
lest you begin your life at levels already traversed.

Your intellectual inheritance are the books,
that will make you wise, strong, unbreakable.

They are an upgrade for your mind,
they mark the initial steps of your transcendence.

From a child, to a great being,
which is what growing all the way up means.

You see, adventure is not just great, but necessary,
because you are, __so, much, more__, than you know.
