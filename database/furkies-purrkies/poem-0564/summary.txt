Easy Peasy Growing Up: The Culture Of Greatness
Wednesday • September 15th 2021 • 5:37:22 pm

Junk DNA Accumulates,\
and so do the beneficial changes.

They come from the fundamental principles of nature,\
of physics and chemistry, and so on.

This is something we can feel and touch,\
this is something we can see.

Especially since we each begun as a single cell,\
both in the primordial sense and prior to our mitosis.

---

Junk also accumulates in our cultures and by extension our minds,\
on top of that, most of the beneficial changes require some effort as they have to begin inside out.

We think that thinking is automatic,\
but that is just our minds being beautiful.

Thinking is an intentional process,\
you have to try to think.

---

The automatic route is a lot of trouble,\
and we are NOT that kind of creature.

We are each meant for Greatness,\
not for submission, or servitude, or suffering, or struggling.

Religions, Failed Nations, Liars, Manipulators, Criminals,\
want us to submit, they want us to serve, they want us to find meaning in suffering, they want us to struggle.

But that is fools gold,\
we are each to become Great Being.

And we can easily achieve that by simply entering the culture of Great Beings,\
by spending time with them; by means of befriending them in their books.

---

Please, understand! you don't have to **read** books,\
you can listen to their narrated versions.

Listening is actually much better,\
[especially if you take to the trails](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appalachian+trail+pacific+crest+trail%2C+continental+divide+trail+AT%2C+PCT%2C+CDT).

The people who laugh at you for listening to books,\
they hope to use you, and own you, they want you to be as stupid as possible.

They are neither friend,\
nor family,

---

Don't approach philosophy directly,\
first learn about the lives of the authors.

Then before listening to their works,\
read study guides to get the maximum out of them.

---

Books are the only way,\
the urge to read, the the change that follows must come from within you.

If you fail to transform,\
[especially when you are unlucky enough to be born to a life of violence or crime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpaFX6Ei0nU) by sheer accident, keep trying.

For those of us who don't get into any trouble,\
the transformation into the culture of greatness...

...r minds strong and healthy,\
that is what our elder-selves would ask for,\
that is what will keep our minds of harms way,\
that is what will make the world laugh,\
and that is what will keep it moving and advancing forward.

What follows is a very short list of amazing people,\
that could perhaps help you in your amazing journeys.
