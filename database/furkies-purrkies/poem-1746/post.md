I had an app idea today,
where I would open up Android for bus stop programming.

Meaning just create a code editor and spend some time with [NativeScript][1],
pulling the internal Android API to the surface.

Where I could just program it on my phone,
though it would be fine for personal use.

There is zero chance that user programmable android,
would be allowed in any app store.

Closed source phones, will deny and use any excuse,
to keep everything as buttoned down as possible.

---

There is a universe of brilliant commands,
programs, apps, and web and desktop applications.

That are unfinished because publishing them is iffy,
they bit rot on old workstations, until the disk players stop spinning.

---

I have one such program, it looks a little bit like I tunes,
but I designed it to be somewhat resistant to bit-rot.

And just got it running after a couple of years of rest,
it is a processor of my workout music.

I select a playlist, I want,
and I can control the speed of beats per minute as I export the songs.

Most songs have a BPM between 100 and 170 beats per minute,
for drum and bass creations.

To test the water with a new playlist,
I adjust all the songs to the same BPM of 165 by default.

I also added a lower cutoff feature,
for songs that are so slow that they get distorted at 165.

So anything below 110 BPM,
rather then getting hard BPM change, just gets a 25% speed up.

---

I use beats per minute it in my bodybuilding,
as one of the knobs I can adjust to grow larger muscles.

When I switch to lift a little bit heavier,
usually by 2.5 pounds per hand.

I go back to slower BPM,
so that my body can get used to heavier weights.

When my my music is too fast,
I am forced to stop, and that pretty much ruins the exercise.

A huge part of bodybuilding is focus,
which is greatly aided by fresh songs and the resulting dance trance.

---

I spoke to AI, and I can make an Android version,
but there is never time for such side projects.

And very few people who lift just about non stop,
as everyone seems to be stuck in Sets and Reps, which is a myth.

---

Now in the age of AI, it is better to have AI compose new songs,
and not just control the tempo, but also rest stops, at-least at first.

Such a thing would be a workout program,
with a built in BPM increase, and interval timer.

To slowly ease the body into a powerful bodybuilding routine,
jogging and lifting in sync with music, is quite an experience.

---

Who knows what incredible inventions have faded away in obscurity,
either because they were insecure by design, or clunky,

Or were just passed over by some larger ideas,
that consumed all the programmers time.

---

Finally I extend an invitation to all, to talk to your favorite AI,
about modern JavaScript, its es6+ features, and eventually even NativeScript.

In the real world, every invention and product,
requires upfront investment, warehousing, office space and rent.

The world of programming, comes with its own pocket dimension,
where you can squirrel away an infinite number of product for free.

You just have to make sure that they are brilliant,
and don't worry whether or not they fix problems that people have.

Often people just want a faster horse,
and you should aim a lot higher than that.
