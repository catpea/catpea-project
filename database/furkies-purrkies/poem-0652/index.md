Perhaps bicycling on ice,\
isn't always nice.

But if there is some snow,\
then you should totally give it a go.

Just get a backpack and a thermos of tea,\
and set yourself free.

---

And if bicycling is something you don't like,\
then get a fat tire bike.

They are not as wobbly and iffy,\
and still take you anywhere in a jiffy.

They will push all the snow aside,\
and won't slip and slide.

It is amazing to ride into the snow,\
especially if you go slow.

And have some crackers and cheese on hand,\
riding winters feels like discovering new land.

And you know...\
you can wear short sleeves if you bicycle in snow.

---

To make your ride even more fun,\
get a wide seat before your run.

And just in case brings some gloves along,\
especially if your adventure will run long.

You are sure to find others riding too,\
it is rare to be the first one to plow through.

I happen to live near the I-275 bicycle trail,\
and have great adventures without a fail.

Though I did fall a time or two,\
riding in the snow is something I always look forward to.

I am sure you too have a trail that runs near,\
so [get a fat tire bike and ride with no fear](https://www.amazon.com/s/?k=fat+tire+bikes).
