Your body is an adaptive self renewing biomechanical machine,
you can adapt it, by gradually challenging it.

Overeating, makes people gradually become heavier than they should be,
so their musculature grows to match the challenge.

Listen, a fat baby can do it,
you shouldn’t be a… fat cry baby about it.

---

Lets talk about what fat babies don’t do,
they don’t walk into a room grab a heavy object and lay down grunting.

They keep walking around, to the consternation of their parents,
presumably foraging for candy.

And it does not help that some people,
put candies up on Christmas trees – what the heck?

---

If a fat baby became overwhelmed with weight,
they wouldn't be able to move around for long enough to grow muscle.

This is exactly what everyone does at the gym today,
lift heavy, for just 15 seconds, cut of circulation, and LAaAY there.

The myth of modern bodybuilding,
even brings shame to fat babies.

I always say the keyword is “gradual”,
but we should understand the challenge is “continues” as well.

You might have noticed how people have a skinny leg,
after their cast is removed, that’s the same thing astronauts go through.

Once you stop bodybuilding,
your muscles will go back to normal, reasonable shape.

From the other end, you can see how little time it takes,
for a person to regain the muscle on their legs – months.

And they just do it by supporting their own weight,
they don’t crush it with heavy weight .

That’s probably what got them in trouble,
in the first place.

Gradually and Continuously challenging your body,
will have it adapt, and throw in a little extra.

Unless you overdo it, and exercise in a way,
that forces you to stop, so that you only walk for 30 seconds a day,

I often mention inheriting a race horse,
and training it not by taking it on rides.

But weighing it down,
so that it only walks 45 feet, before it becomes too painful to move.

A horse that only walks 40 feet a day will get sick,
and we get sick when we only lift for 45 seconds a the gym.

We gain weight, we age, our bones become weaker,
we have low self esteem, and start to look old and ugly.

The modern workout as we all know it from the gym,
makes you old and brittle.

---

A workout begins relative to what shape you are in,
I begun by walking to a near by store.

The fact that we are built for walking,
is another one of our superpowers.

For longer distances,
I would bicycle.

Hiking is what makes walking sweet,
there we burnt he most fat.

Not just because there is no chair to sit on,
but because we do away with bad diet habits.

You get a sausage, and you better fall asleep at sunset,
because there is no light-switch either, only spiders.

The wisdom of babies, teaches us,
you crawl, you walk, you jog, you make your Mama proud.

You don’t come into a gym, start lifting heavy, for 45 seconds,
and sit, and call it a day.

A full workout is one hour no rest, you earn that endurance,
by first walking for an hour with three pound weights.

You may need to stop and sit at first,
but before you know it you will be able to walk straight through.

Then you walk with heavier weights,
here it is no longer basic endurance, it is new muscle and strength.

Think back to your beginning,
you had it right back then, you big baby.

Gradually, continuously,
non stop.

Lift light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy that you just sit there.

Lifting heavy isn’t impressive when you do it fo ages...
constantly cutting off your circulation, and choking yourself into sitting.

And have nothing,
to show for it.

You have to slip beneath failure,
so that you can flex and twist, and turn, for an hour or two with dumbbells.

What is impressive, is never quite aging,
reminding life, who is living it.

You are a great ape,
so act like one, with dumbbells in hands.
