It all starts pretty easy,
just a few fancy words that describe unusual, but, eventually pretty friendly things.

But you know, there is something about programming,
that will help you travel all the way up.

---

The apps of the future will be Web Based,
so it is again JavaScript, HTML based JavaScript Object Orchestration.

And applying Object Styles or Properties,
by selecting Objects by their attributes.

On top of this you add Signals with map, filter and reduce,
or state, derived and effect, if you are a lovely weirdo.

And you put your HTML inside signal subscription or effect,
or use a tagged template literal that give you a weird tree with reactive attributes.

And at this point you make custom web components,
gradient maker is a great example as the controls are absent from HTML.

And you just nest them to create WebExtensions/Add-ons, applications,
desktop with electron, smartphone with some NativeScript madness, and web.

---

Where your social network profile,
can be completely what you want it to be…

Your selection of 3 if you are tidy, 6 if you are fierce, or 9 if you mean it,
applications, can’t be freaking faked in any way.

It is who you are, it is your design portfolio, it is your resume if you are into that,
it is a display of the content of your character.

---

Some of your apps can have a dedicated website,
with fascinating screenshots… and a Sign-up button, starting at $4/mo.

Maybe one will be an app store it self, that people can buy,
to launch their own, or use AI to put apps into.

(With enough users wishing to make a sale, you just ask them to self advertise,
and their store page will run ads for other shops as well.)

And then security apps, design, netsec, hacking, sigint,
only you can tell, which is how people will be able to tell who you are.

---

If you decide to become a programmer,
you will write thousands of libraries, framework, commands, websites and apps.

If you keep programming, close, but only as a fascinating game,
as a brain teaser, then maybe all you’ll make is the 3 0r 9.

Though not at once,
one at a time.

A sentimental one in Middle School, a rebellious one in High School,
the big make maker one in College, and the classy one, when you retire.

---

I maybe experienced boredom once, I am not even sure,
at about 10 give or take a year I started programming.

And I have spent all my life fascinated by complexity,
in hot pursuit of elegant solutions to brain teasers.

I don’t paper or pencil, I just close my eyes,
and move along use cases, interesting apps I glanced.

Today, I spent at least 30 minutes with my eyes closed at the gym,
dreaming up a website color theme creator.

A completely novel problem under AI,
I am 99% sure nobody touched it yet.

AI based website theme maker with a template generator,
is clearly, clearly a big money maker.

People just pay, upload an image, set a logo and brand color,
and can generate unique Design Systems to no end.

From code to color, all of this is AI,
when something is broken…

They post a comment to an AI based social network,
part of your company, and the AI will generate a new revision of code for all.

So one company with one bug, uses a human to catch a bug,
and then fixes and verified it for all you customers – the just click update.

---

The more sign-ups you have, the more eyes,
and they because they need it user interfaces for their own moneymaking.

So as long as you build one on top of the other,
the AI is correct, money is everywhere.

Though this is about class,
this is about pursuits of excellence.

---

It is about greatness, it is about you recognizing,
there is no path forward without pursuits of excellence.

You gain noting by temporary memorizing for quizzes,
if anything the teacher gains the pleasure of watching you fail at life.

And for a mere good grade,
that they pull out of their fat butt.

---

Please accept the responsibility,
for your own self education.

And understand that to grow up,
must and must only mean, growing all the way up, not part way.

And that means, you are charged,
with becoming a Great Being.
