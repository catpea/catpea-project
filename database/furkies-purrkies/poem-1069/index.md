The groundhog only pretends to be super freaking cute,
he __hates us__ from head to boot.

They actually make the snow,
they cook it up deep in their burrow.

You see the prediction is just a cover, a lie,
the Groundhog is certainly not the good guy.

The cuddly little bastard never gets sore.
he only wants more winter, to sleep more, more, more.

He wants us to wear fur winter coats,
until we __too__, turn into fat lazy marmots.

---

But, no, we will not obey,
today, Today, we riiiiiise against the Groundhog Day.

---

They are bubbly and sweet but laAzy,
they want to see the world cold and crazy.

And by knowing that the ground hog is not out pal,
we can now fight back, and so we shall.

---

We will no loner be the Jiggly Groundhogs puppet,
we will instead tell him to __by golly, stop it__.

And the message __will__ ring loud and clear,
though we may get goosebumps, we shall persevere.

From now on, on each Groundhog Day,
we put our winter coats away.
