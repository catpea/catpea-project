Computer Programming For All
Wednesday • June 28th 2023 • 11:29:42 pm

The Teenagers need but a LINE 1 PRINT HELLO WORLD,
followed by LINE 2 GOTO LINE 1; and they can take it from there.

For them programming flows, and eventually they will say,
usernames map get account from username and now accounts filter past-due.

But as we grow life will flourish, and the fascination of GOTO and PRINT,
or Array Map, Filter, Reduce…

Will get lost in all the other fascinating things about life.
all the philosophies that must be thought up.

And all the half interesting hobbies we tend to,
to make room for our thinking.

---

This is why a more mature person,
can’t connect with programming.

There are other more interesting things,
other more comfortable things.

---

And this is why,
to help a more mature person learn programming.

We have to connect programming,
to one of their more down to earth hobbies.

[This is as simple as creating a Camera to stream a bird feeder][1]
[or ensuring optimal moisture in a flower bed][2].

To mention some of the less important hobbies,
but more popular philosophical breaks.

---

The key component here is not the hardware though,
but [Node-RED][3]; a visual programming language.

Node-RED is a JavaScript based visual programming system,
that allows custom JavaScript inside the visual programming nodes.

And while learning a Visual Programming Language is neat,
it is that little JavaScript code editor inside a node.

That serves as the true starting point,
to learning programming.

Eventually, if there is time in all the sunny days,
a new challenge will call out.

This one will be framed purely in the world of code,
that 10 PRINT HELLO; 20 GOTO 10 realm.

The challenge will be to program a Node-RED alternative,
and a great deal of inspiration behind this challenge.

Is the fact that you don’t have to finish
programming the Visually Programming Language.

You just need to get to a point
where the Node-RED like Visual Programming Language - can program it self.

At this point they would begin replacing the manual code,
with visual code.

Here, in all this meditation,
they may consider launching a small side project.

Users would pay a couple of dollars per month,
to use the more premium features of their Visual Programming Language.

And there would be money,
to spend on kids and grand kids.

Or perhaps,
a business empire.

Where the legacy of the,
initial developer, and the first version.

Would, always be thought of,
with warmth, smiles, and great admiration.
