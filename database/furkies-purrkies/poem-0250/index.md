The only thing that divides Humanity,

is levels of education.

The more educated we become,

the closer we come together.

With real education,

comes wisdom.

Humanity is destined,

to come together in Wisdom and Peace.

To hasten our Convergence on Wisdom,

we must accept the responsibility for our own education.

We are each perfectly unique,

there is no such thing as a standard human mind.

We must choose our own books the books we enjoy,

and walk the path that fits us best book by book, at just the right pace.

A book is a stored wisdom,

where our body needs food our mind needs books.

Books accelerate our intellectual development,

books are inherited best when read by a fine narrator.

It will take a hundred books to find the ten we need,

and poetically speaking our mind will merge with their wisdom.

We will become wiser, more compassionate,

more authentic, stronger, calmer and more creative.

While looking at ourselves we see the common Humanity,

we are more than that.

When the younger generations look at us,

we are a call to Enlightenment, to Inspiration, and Knowledge and Wisdom.

Who we are,

is where all the world's children follow.

Let us delay no more,

and take to books right now.

Let us help those who have difficulty reading,

by helping them to narrated versions.

And let us not forget,

that Greatness calls to All Beings.

Therefore, let us all become Wise and Great,

so that the Younger Generations may follow.
