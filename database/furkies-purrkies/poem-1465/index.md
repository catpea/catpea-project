I am writing a strange little program,
that helps to visualize program structure.

It can generate code based on diagrams,
host code editors, and even external websites.

I wrote 4 versions in recent years,
each with a much smaller code base.

And I am starting to like this one,
even though it uses a custom OOP like language.

It really helped with code clarity,
and taking care of all the grunt work.

OOP Means Object Oriented Programming,
it is just a way to group program parts.

---

An old technology has risen,
to reach the browser called WebStreams or Stream API.

And it is just the perfect thing
for a program that connects stuff.

Streaming was invented,
not to load stuff into memory.

But rather to pass the stuff along,
a chunk at a time.

A large video can be streamed,
a video frame at a time.

---

Streams also feature the concept,
of transforming data.

You can convert a video to black and white,
again, one frame at a time.

Efficiently,
with little to none memory cost.

---

Now I am looking at my computer program,
wondering, what else can it do.

I wrote the insides of the program,
to be predictable.

All the parts sit,
where they are largely expected to be.

While I fully intend to create,
a visual programming language.

Where many different concepts,
can be smartly connected together.

---

I also have many tiny project ideas,
sometimes it seems like all good ideas.

Absolutely, demand a flexible,
Visual Programming Language.

I think this will influence,
the final program design.

I will create something much more flexible,
than just a visual programming language.

The code base, aside from being readable,
is small and well though out.

---

I can use the concept of Stream Transformers,
and my programs ability to connect code editors together.

To create an application control flow and logic builder,
where transformers process user input.

For example, when a form is submitted,
it can be processed by a visual environment, now.

---

Most of the programming goes into library code,
stuff that can be reused.

And what actually ties well written programs together,
is quite small.

It can be easily represented,
even in a simple visual program like mine.

---

I guess I should take a moment
to create a code editor network.

As a way to test what I created thus far,
and see if maybe I can program.

The rest of the program with it self,
it would be easier to understand everything.

---

I've been programming forever,
early teens.

I've learned many programming languages,
once you know a few it gets really easy.

I recommend learning just one, JavaScript,
it is sturdy and flexible.

Programming is all about inventing,
imagining new machines and building them.

A good machine, becomes a plateau you step on,
and multiplies your powers.

You learn programming and use it,
to become a more powerful programmer.

While I would encourage trying everything out,
every which way.

The best computer program code,
is the one that is smallest and most predictable.

A code base,
that you can grow with.

My best piece of advice is about understating,
that while you can create anything.

The thing that is strongest, and simplest,
is much more valuable than biggest and heaviest.

It is the small programs,
that stick around.
