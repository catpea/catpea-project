The School Game; Or, Move Education Far And Away And From Any And All Influence Of Politics
Sunday • June 19th 2022 • 8:03:52 am

And to protect education, to make it permanently real,\
we must remove it from the control of any and all politicians.

It may seem like they may not directly influence what is taught,\
at least in more developed nations - but that is false.

Raising tuition, is the same, or worse,\
as teaching a fantasy, or opinion, over fact.

Underpaying teachers and lowering standards,\
is the same as hiring actors that, eventually, merely pretend to teach.

The politicians don't have to ask to burn, or ban, or rewrite the books,\
they just need to keep the prices high, and effort low, and the rest will take care of it self.

---

For all the outstanding teachers in the world,\
and their arguments against computerized education.

There are millions of teachers,\
that cause overwhelming harm, that result s in people moving away from books.

This is not a try harder scenario,\
there are only two kinds of education systems with nothing in between.

It is either ineffective and fake,\
or real and profound.

---

For a dictator to triumph,\
they must collapse education.

Education does not collapse on its own,\
it is our greatest invention - it is our natural direction.

A well educated nation,\
has high standards for political seats.

A high demand for honesty and long term vision of the future,\
and most importantly peer reviewed accomplishments, that eventually pave the way into politics.

---

In a nation with collapsed education,\
you will find cult and nationalism.

And again, that is not by chance,\
it is a pre-requisite for political criminals to flourish.

Any kind of educational interference,\
will always lead to war, crime, and suffering.

The collapse of education is rarely about the burning of books,\
and most often, imperceptible.

---

It is easy for well funded organizations,\
to attack education.

They will prevent canceling of debt,\
be it by nation-wide forgiveness or personal bankruptcy.

Or they will simply do nothing as tuition fees rise,\
or, cause interference in hopes of lowering tuition.

They will do nothing to increase teacher pay,\
nothing to encourage better teachers.

They will stand by as schools become ineffective,\
and books get banned, and inner-city schools beg for funding.

Before long studen...

... nations with warped criminal justice.

We see mass incarceration,\
in a nation whose amendment on slavery, still clearly states that a criminal is a slave.

---

Not only must we protect real education,\
but we are yet to bring nations into such an advanced state.

---

We must begin the creation of a real school that follows the student,\
as soon as they begin caring about the world, as soon as they have questions.

And we must make sure that the answers are the best that we have,\
that a child is not made into a fool.

---

Today school is seen as a place that a child goes to,\
and a lot of children see it as stressful, fake, and punishing.

Under the threat of poverty [students are forced to give up on real education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY),\
and begin [a fantasy education that revolves around grades and graduations and tests they would fail if they had to retake again later on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY).

---

We can't trust the politics of a nation,\
but we can trust peer reviewed automated school materials that function more like a game.

Rather than demanding obedience by marking a student down,\
with a grade that eventually convinces them and their future employers they are unintelligent.

We simply create a range of educational systems where students where students have to progress as if in a game,\
where a door will be closed to them until they beat the level.

And the levels or the curriculum,\
must be always of their own choosing.

Middle School, High School, College turned into a friendly and rewarding computer game,\
when beat, a person can hold up the paths they traveled as great achievement, as something to be truly proud of.

---

Make no mistake, I am asking you to remove education,\
from the hands of politicians, well meaning or not.

I am asking you to put beautiful education in the hands of children,\
so that they may grow independent of the artificial or political culture of whatever the place they happened to be born into.

By the time they grow to make use of real education,\
most of the world politicians will have long retired.

It costs the world next to nothing to grant the younger generations,\
a wiser, better, safer, and more peaceful world.
