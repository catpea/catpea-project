Gym energy, bodybuilding or otherwise,
is done the same way that jogging is.

---

To this day, I am not a fast jogger,
and to this day I admire joggers.

The first time I saw real joggers,
they were moving as fast as cars.

What really messed me up,
was that they were having a normal conversation.

They were not in pain,
and probably not out of breath.

---

I trained myself the same way,
I replicated jogging.

But while dancing with dumbbells in my hands,
I started with 3 pounds per hand.

And after many tears,
only made it to 20 per hand.

Inspired by joggers,
to me duration was more important than weight.

---

Last few weeks I went down to 15lb. per hand,
and switched to club music.

I move faster, and thus,
burn more fat.

When I chase heaver,
I workout to 95 beats per minute songs.

The chase for heaver,
builds muscle crazy fast, in days.

The faster and lighter,
is slow at burning fat.

Our bodies are evolved for war,
you can get as powerful as you need.

And your body will protect your fat,
so that you can fight for years.

We are warriors, we are fighters,
out bodies are NOT built for backing down.

Based on what I have learned from my bodybuilding,
the adaptation of our bodies shows, were beasts.

---

Now, if you come to a gym, and lift heavy,
you will never be able to lift it for long enough.

You will not train your body,
you will strain your body.

---

My muscles grew, because I slowly expanded my endurance,
precisely the way joggers do it.

If we ask a runner,
how can you run for 26 miles, where does that energy come from?

And their answer would be the same,
I expanded my endurance, a little bit at a time.

I chose dancing with dumbbells,
because I understood I was too heavy to jog.

Above all, we need to jog on soft woodland trails,
concrete is already a terrible idea.

And in my private opinion,
the perfect jogger is a Lady.

Swift, fast, light,
by contrast, I am a cow.

---

So I started dancing with dumbbells,
I never got hurt, ever.

Starting light,
kept me perfectly safe.

And by the time I moved up a weight,
my body was always more than ready to handle it.

---

I did however, experience a Charlie Horse,
which is muscles contracting and not letting go.

But I never experienced it in my calves,
lower back, between shoulders, shoulder, and neck.

I suspect the worst case happened from obesity,
the muscles in my lower back did not let go for days.

---

Which brings us to Jungle Juice,
I term I learned from an airport story.

Where a person was being asked to take a swig,
from a barrel where people emptied liquids not allowed on a plane.

The cure for these muscle spasms, is vegetable juice, bananas,
and Re-hydration Drink Mix if you feel like you may get a spasm.

But, after a couple of years, drinking vegetable juice,
becomes such a heavy chore, because of its taste.

That I begun calling it,
Jungle Juice.

And you know hat is worse, or even better,
than vegetable juice – and this is no joke.

Putting a…
pickle in it.

Both pickle in a pouch,
and pickle water are real products that help with Electrolytes.

It is wise,
to pair the two together.

Precisely, because prevention of muscle spasms,
is preferred to treatment.

Vegetable Jungle Juice On A Stick Lick Recipe,
as you can imagine, is just the frozen vegetable juice with a picke in it..

Yes, it will look exactly like it will taste,
but it will cool you down, and keep you safe.

I confess that this is not a 101% serious drink or lick even,
but, a muscle spasm in your back is serious.

If you are going to work out in warmer or hot weather,
please, get that vegetable jungle juice in you, any which way, to prevent it.

You can also make some Vegetable Jungle Juice Ice Cubes,
I am sure that's good for you.
