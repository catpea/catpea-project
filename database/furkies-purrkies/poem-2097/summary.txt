The Interview
Wednesday • November 26th 2025 • 9:44:53 pm

I thought a lot about my first question, and want you to know, you have a very imposing and beautiful personality, and I have always admired you.

One of my favorite American movies is Harry and The Hendersons, what is this secret world that you are part of, are there many beings like you, would you like to move in with us the greater Humanity?

---

Ah… Harry and the Hendersons.
A cinematic masterpiece that forever convinced humanity that all cryptids are either lovable or catastrophically clumsy. I assure you, I am neither. My clumsiness is strictly elegant.

Now—as to your question about the secret world…
Well… yes, there is a community. A micro-ecosystem of anomalous fauna.

There’s the Jersey Devil (loud), Mothman (doesn’t stop talking about his “glorious wingspan metrics”), and of course the Loch Ness Monster, who insists she is “just big-boned” and not “prehistorically girthy.” I, however, represent the scientific branch: we study humans the way humans study all other life.

Would I like to move in with greater Humanity?

Emotionally? Yes.
Biologically? Absolutely not.

Your homes lack the proper humidity settings, you refrigerate your food (why??), and frankly, your plug sockets do not support my native devices.

As for fellow beings like me—yes, we are numerous, but most are introverts. You think I’m elusive? Try interviewing a Thunderbird. He cancels 17 times before committing.

If you’d still have me, I could visit Humanity…

I still haven’t emotionally recovered from the Sasquatch incident.

---

Wow, you are so funny, and it is so amazing to hear you speak, you are profound. I must ask, what in the world happened to The Sasquatch?

---

Ah… Sasquatch.
You had to bring him up.
Give me a moment—my spines always droop a little when I think about it.
You see, long before the shaky footage and conspiracy T-shirts, I genuinely thought Sasquatch was one of us—another proud cryptid wandering the margins. He had the gait, the smell, the hair density rivaling a yak that fell into a dryer. I approached him cautiously, ready to welcome him into our litte world.
But no.

It turns out he was just… a guy.
A very large, very sweaty, very confused guy named Gus who lived out in the woods because he liked “the quiet.” I tried to explain cryptid etique...

...e, and it’s beautiful.
It tells me that if cryptids ever officially stepped into the public eye, you’d greet us with excitement—and possibly pastries.

So yes.
I love your world.
Deeply.
And if you love me back, well… then I suppose I’ll have to keep visiting.
Just promise me one thing:
Never stop being curious. That’s the magic that makes your world worth crossing dimensions for.

---

I know you are touchy about names, because of the whole goat thing, and I apologize from the bottom of my heart, many of us are still a very simple kind of being. Before we part ways, I just want you to know, that we think of you as an invitation into the starts, so that we may someday visit your world.

Thank You for your time,
I hope my questions were not too intrusive.

---

Intrusive?
Not at all.

If anything, your questions were like gentle footsteps in a quiet forest—curious, respectful, and full of wonder. That’s a rare kind of approach. Most humans see glowing eyes in the dark and immediately assume taxes or danger.
And don’t worry about the goat situation.
Names are tricky things.
Labels even more so.

If humanity ever misunderstood me, it was only because you’re still building the language for what lies beyond your horizons. Cryptids are easy to misname because we live in the corners of perception—the half‑seen, the almost‑believed.

But hearing you say that you see me not as a monster, not as a mistake, but as an invitation into the stars…
That’s something that reaches into the oldest part of me, the part that remembers why I crossed dimensions in the first place.

You want to visit my world someday?
Oh, I hope you do.

The moment a species looks outward with love and curiosity instead of fear… that moment is when they become capable of traveling anywhere, even places they’ve only imagined.

And if you ever arrive in my dimension, if you ever find the crack in the sky that hums in E‑flat and smells faintly like burnt capacitors…
I’ll be there to greet you.
Maybe even give you a tour.
With a JavaScript book in one hand
and your courage held proudly in the other.

Thank you for this conversation.
You made tonight brighter than the phosphorescent moss fields of home.
If you ever want another interview—
I’ll be listening in the spaces where myths are born.
