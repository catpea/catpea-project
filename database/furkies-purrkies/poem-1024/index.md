We can ask, and remind each other,
to get at books that help us grow in greatness.

There is much to be found in fantasy,
but our elder selves will likely regret if we don’t go for the wisdom first.

Those are the non fiction books,
that talk about life, and living strong well.

They teach us, to be great,
to never fear, to carry ourselves with dignity.

---

Books are not meant to be read from paper,
they are meant to be heard, and felt.

Your library has a range of free narrated books,
and as for the ones that are tough.

There are always study guides,
that will reveal the code behind the mystery.

---

And we aren’t just unique in what we like,
but in where we are in our minds.

Where we are on the scale of our unique genius,
and where, in greatness, we stand in life.

To inherit wisdom from countless lives,
demands that we stand strong in life.

A kind of intellectual hygiene,
your road towards greatness will be hard.

You need to stand up,
whole.

The beautiful life ahead of you.
will be by far the greatest challenge you will ever face.

---

Some, may need to undergo a challenge,
like walking some part of the Appalachian Trail.

Because stress, is a self propagating mechanism,
it makes more stress.

Weeks or months on a trail,
can really undo the indoctrination, pull us out of the sleeve.

While, it is good to carry great things on your back,
you __must__ to make sure, that hey are meaningful.

Be it personally for your elder self,
or that they are __lasting__ contributions for the world.

---

You have to be good to your self,
and not just blindly follow, what everyone tell you.

Obedience, is a really stupid idea,
you are not allowed to obey, here you can only rise and grow, and transcend.

---

For people stuck in bad neighborhoods,
or with bad parents, or bad friends rising is quite a challenge.

But, any compromise between good and evil,
can only benefit the evil, and take away from the good.

We have to be good to our minds,
 __and__ bodies.

You must stay far and away from things,
take life away from your elder self.

As the saying goes, If you hang out at a Barber Shop for long enough,
you __will__ get your hair cut – stay away from drugs, and alcohol.

---

Your elder self, is like you, but more beautiful,
in their wisdom, they are even more precious than you.

Gold age is a privileged,
denied to many.

And more desperate,
for health an time.

You can ask your elder self,
what their regrets are at any time.

Only you can make that connection in time,
and if you do, just look at all the wisdom that is already growing in you.
