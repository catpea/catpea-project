This text is for young people, but not just young in age,
it is pretty rebelious.

But it is crafted to serve as a start,
prove it wrong, prove it right...

But most importantly, keep learning,
don't do the same thing and expect different results, rise!

Do not let your guardians destroy you,
just to whimper in the end "How was I supposed to know?"

---

As you can no doubt tell, there exist sacred places on Earth,
they are untouchable by Presidents, Prime Ministers, Priests & Popes.

They are called The Libraries,
and any an all who try their hand at their destruction will perish.

They are under constant attack, and each attack is more clever,
than the previous.

Today libraries are flooded by meaningless books,
whose shareholders and authors purchased the label of bestseller for.

You can’t just check out one of the top selling books,
they are highly unlikely to hold any value what so ever.

They will not change your life for the better,
and sometimes peddle a secret as simplistic at this:

“Try the same thing every day,
as you may eventually arrive at a result.”

That is how you lay lottery, how you get lucky,
that is not real advice rising, or building.

That advice, wastes your time, your energy for books,
and make a total fool out of you for attempting to read such a book.

---

But, closing libraries is not how the world will die,
as that would make you rip the attackers to shreds, first.

No, instead, you will discover no attackers,
you will be left wondering if it is the mediocrity of the people.

Perhaps, but any of them can choose to rise,
and most will at the precipice.

---

The real attack will destroy your mind, completely,
and will be as swift as the strike of a skilled warrior.

Your parents will become poor,
they will force you to work.

In the stress you will have no time,
to tend to your brilliance, and give up thinking on your own.

And just like no Islander remembers the last tree on Easter Island,
no one will notice the passing of the last dreamer.

Once you have fought your way to a sliver of happiness and joy,
your uneducated children will be taken to fight in a war.

Those who return will changed, happy, and with medals on their chest,
so much so, that your heart will shatter.

And the others,
the others, will never return at all.

Your well meaning parents, and your hard work,
the shattered minds of children will unravel the world.

As your obese leaders, driven by anti-depressants,
and a permanent delusion of being remembered as great.

For sending millions to die in war,
a task only a great being could do…

Choke, on their vomit,
to the silent merriment of the guards at their door.

---

Do not worry, this has not yet happened,
and now that you know about it, never will.

---

But you must never sacrifice your brilliance,
and, you must protect Libraries and Schools.

It is a mistake for you to think you are just a students,
while letting your teacher pretend to teach.

You have to learn,
to teach them a lesson.

And permanently hold a new course for humanity,
one that is away from the inauthentic, the make-believe, and the pretenders.

These are people,
who will manipulate your own family against you.

Who won’t even flinch, you turn off your mind, with the words:
“I can’t, I have a job now”.

You are up against a force that destroys the world,
look how easily it has corrupted some of your classmates into bullies.

One they, their morose countenance,
becomes a smile, as they become, their beating dads.

This is not a force,
you trifle with.

---

Go to the sacred place,
and find old books about the Old Philosophers.

Learn about who they were,
and begin growing up into the great beings they became.

You will not know a real school,
until you build one yourself.

You will not have a graduation,
until you walk the [Triple Crown of Hiking][1].

---

May you not know peace,
until you become a great being.
