It is a lot easier to create revolutionary software,
than it may seem.

Most often, you are actually,
independently re-inventing.

There are countless millions of other programmers,
it is rare to do something original.

But more than that,
I invented [this thing][1] years ago.

It was crazy to me that I couldn't nest things,
I don't want to create a color for everything.

I sat down with CSS or maybe SCSS,
and started typing.

It just made sense to have up classes,
where at each up class things get brighter, by remain stable.

---

Back then I was learning Bootstrap,
because I’ve noticed they use slow wisdom.

Now, I have surpassed them,
and [created my own CSS framework][2].

It is not a big deal, they are slow,
because they are wise.

---

My color system system is just an x/y grid,
gradients dictate shades or levels.

And then columns, have a color transformer,
to allow text to be different from the background.

I am currently simulate shadows,
I drop luminosity and mix in some blue, but that is just a test.

---

blueberries, and epidermis are sub projects,
that fall under the big one.

The name is a disaster, I can’t say it,
it is amazing, hopefully some else registers it first.

---

Even though it is my invention,
and AI appears to be surprised.

It was not possible top program thins in two weeks,
without AI writing the code.

---

In reverse that means,
if you learn a little bit of programming.

Enough to be able to tell when AI is making mistakes,
you are ready to go.

This .up invention, and its colors,
is very simple, any teenager can come up with it.

You just need some code ideas and AI,
code ideas come to you early on.

When you are not weighted down,
by the way others are doing things.

The moment I started learning other systems,
I stopped inventing new ones.

I returned wiser, and much more powerful,
but it is the same idea.

Today AI can help you with making good ideas into good code,
while you learn along he way.

Einstein had to learn the math for attractors,
after he figured out relativity.

---

There is nothing to stop you,
from inventing at the beginning of your programming journey.

The little things that get to you in the beginning,
are the same problems everyone faces.

If you tackle them,
you’ll be building bridges that people will want to cross.

And that, means good business,
that is exactly the welcome you should expect from programming.
