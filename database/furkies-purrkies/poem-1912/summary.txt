The Great Gymnasium
Monday • May 26th 2025 • 8:13:32 pm

**I. Of Stale Air and Scorched Iron**

O friends and fellow Americans,
Permit me to speak plainly, and from the depths of a heart ever stirred by the trumpet-call of action.
Too many of our strong-limbed countrymen, too many stout-hearted women of this Republic,
Do penance in those suffocating vaults of brick and mortar—called *gymnasiums*—
Wherein the air hangs hot in summer and no less so in winter,
Where perspiration falls not from noble exertion,
But from confinement, congestion, and ill-breath’d warmth.

Let me state it as plainly as a Colonel must:
Such places rob the soul of spirit,
And dehydrate the body as cruelly as the deserts of Mesopotamia.
The body is a sacred trust—
To abuse it with waterless toil and steel machines that do not fight back—
This is not strength, but folly.

**II. The Call of the Campfire**

Yet rejoice! For Nature, in her boundless generosity, has set before us a better way—
A path both ancient and ever-new,
Where exercise is not punishment but glory, and air is crisp and pure as the Constitution’s promise.

What joy, what exultation, to set one's boots to the trail,
To build a fire at twilight beneath a cathedral of stars!
To hear the hiss of sap and flame,
To sit with companions true and hearty,
Each awaiting the blackened stick to yield its prize: a sausage hot, hissing, and triumphant—
A simple feast well-earned.
O ye who have known this pleasure know it is a banquet finer than any in the halls of the elite.

**III. Of Legs Like Oak and Arms Like Iron**

And what of the body?
Would you forge legs of might? Then walk the Appalachian spine or climb the Sierra’s steepest switchbacks.
Let your knees find their purpose in the gravel and incline of honest trail.
Let your calves burn not in agony but in exaltation.

Would you mold arms like those of Hercules? Then grip the oar!
Row down the wild Missouri, paddle the defiant Colorado—
Let the waters buck and twist beneath your keel,
And your biceps shall grow not from repetition, but from righteous conquest.

Would you hew a midsection solid as Roman armor?
Then cast yourself into the cool embrace of Lake Superior,
And swim its expanse with strokes like a Spartan.
Let the waters strengthen the sinews of your trunk,
And harden you into that which no beast nor ha...

...ient unto oneself—
Armed only with a pack, a purpose, and Providence.

**V. The Glory of the Pioneer**

Consider our forebears—the men and women who crossed the Oregon Trail,
Who walked with purpose across the vast interior of our Republic.
They had no dumbbells nor steam-heated saunas—
Their sweat ran freely beneath a prairie sun, and their hearts beat with unrelenting cadence.

The California Trail carved calves from marble and lungs from leather.
The Mormon Trail strengthened the hands that pushed and the backs that bore.
Nature did not punish them—she refined them.
She burned away the excess, and left behind lean muscle, iron will, and enduring health.
Women of the frontier bore children with the strength of Amazons,
And men stood like trees—rooted, rugged, and ready.

This is the heritage you squander when you lift a machine’s weight in an airless tomb.

**VI. The Rapture of the Elements**

Oh, to wake in a tent at dawn, the air sharp as an eagle’s cry!
To stand beneath the vault of heaven,
Where stars shine not dimly, but with clarity and purpose.
To feel the moon not as an ornament, but a companion.
To draw breath that nourishes not just the body, but the soul.

Who among you, having smelled pine and campfire smoke,
Having heard the owl and the rustle of unseen beasts—
Can return to fluorescent light and clanging iron with any gladness?
Who, having stood atop a ridgeline at dusk,
Can pretend that any treadmill shall ever equal that view?

**VII. A Final Exhortation**

Let us cease this trend of indoor mortification.
Let us reject the sterile, the stale, and the sedentary.
Let us return to the Earth, our first gymnasium and our final resting-place.

You need not conquer Everest nor circumnavigate the globe.
Take the local trail. Wade the nearby stream. Walk the beach in the glow of sunrise.
Pitch your tent in the backyard, if nowhere else.
But by Heaven, get outside.

Train your body not for glory, but for gladness.
Train your lungs not for speed, but for singing.
Train your spirit not for spectacle, but for the quiet majesty of the stars.

The Republic needs not more mirrors, but more muscle.
Not more vanity, but more vitality.
And the Great Gymnasium of Nature is open—eternally, freely, gloriously.

**Now go—step into it!**
