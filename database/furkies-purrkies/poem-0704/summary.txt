Groundhog Day: Six More Weeks Of Winter
Wednesday • February 2nd 2022 • 3:50:49 pm

There is a strange animal that kind of speaks,
and it is in charge of Winter ... usually wanting six more weeks.

It's thoughts do not usually run very deep,
he merely wants winter so that he can sleep.

Truth be told,
he looks as tired, as old.

And he is as old,
as we are terrified of the cold.

While some say that he eats babies,
and has long ago gone crazy from rabies.

He's been messing with the weather since, 1886,
and .

Nobody knows anything about him,
and we only know him by his pseudonym.

Some love him, some hate him,
.

But he is as judicious,
as mysterious and suspicious.

We should try to lean more about him,
though our chances are slim.

Until then, I hope you don't mind,
for he will rule over Human Kind.

Simply put, if we wants to sleep more,
there will be snow galore.
