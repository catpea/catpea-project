Interval timer tells you how many rounds you got left,
and how long until the end of your current lifting set and how long you can rest.

Initially you can configure it to 10 rounds of 1 minute exercise,
and 2 minutes rest, a total of 30 minutes, and then adjust it from there.

You should start with slow songs, country,  rather than techno,
and light dumbbell weights that you can handle for 30 minutes.

And you only need dumbbells, you really want ALL your muscles,
to grow out in a natural sequence, so that they support one another.

If you use a machine, or, goodness forbid lay down in a gym,
you will just end up with two or four big muscles.

---

Show up at the gym, turn on your slow music,
grab 3 or 5 pound dumbbells, one per each hand, and start your interval timer.

You will now be buzzed in for a minute of lifting,
and you just need to focus on listing to the beats of slow songs.

You don’t think about time, just focus on lifting,
the timer will vibrate when the minute is up.

Now you can wander the gym, do air guitar, finger guns,
drink water, shimmy-shimmy over to the cooler, just don’t sit.

And after two minutes of rest your timer will vibrate,
to alert you to your big minute of lifting.

And you will do that 10 times,
every day, at first you are lifting light so you can handle it.

---

If at the end of your exercise you feel like it did nothing,
you have to adjust your rest down, to a minute and a half, maybe.

Maybe your songs are just way too slow,
so you will need to add some more energetic ones.

They don’t all have to be the same beats per minute,
but they should be in the same rage, so some can be a bit faster.

---

Maybe, if you started with lifting 3 pound dumbbells,
it is just simply too light for you.

When we put on weight, our muscles adapt too,
so larger people have stronger muscles, maybe mix 3 and 5 pound dumbells.

On every even round lift 5, and on every odd round number,
lift 3, until you switch over to 5.

This is not just a formula for fitness,
but for bodybuilding.

You just keep adding, faster music, tiny bit heavier dumbbells,
increase the number of rounds, decrease the rest period until you eliminate it.

The most important thing about a workout, is that it is pretty much non-stop,
and of considerable duration, like an hour or two.

Weights come in second, and they can’t be so heavy that they stop you,
you have to protect that hard earned non-stop hour.

The result of that, is you increasing your dumbbell weights by just 2 pounds,
and that is something your body can work with.

It will gently adapt so that the new weight feels like nothing, feels natural,
and that is when you go up in weight by two or two and a half more pounds.

And yet again, your body will grow muscle to handle that new weight,
over the course of many months it will keep becoming more and more athletic.

An hour long non stop, is an endurance workout,
that means you are burning fat.

And gently adding more weight,
means you are growing muscle.

There are no threats of injuries with light weights,
but you do need to hydrate to avoid the charlie horse in legs and back, especially.

Wear gloves, and pay attention to your socks, trim your toe claws,
and find wide toe box zero drop shoes, to protect your feet.

But this is just dancing with dumbbells, you’ll get some aches,
as your body becomes more flexible due to fat loss, but this is safe.
