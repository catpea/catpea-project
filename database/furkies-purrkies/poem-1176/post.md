You always walk away from a real lecture,
with awe, of what you, can accomplish now.

---

One of the greatest lies, is that your scattered badly divided subjects,
eventually come together to make you smart.

At first, you are tricked into waiting for an education,
and then once you realize it is a lie.

You are tricked, into a tunnel, where you just want to graduate,
in a way that does not interfere with your future.

You see, you are forced into keeping quiet,
you are threatened with being held back, lies to, and forced to accept fake education.

---

You are bring sold out for paychecks, and it is easy,
because you are too young to know what real education is.

---

Perhaps the following example will help,
to begin appreciating education imagine that you have some already.

Maybe a family member that loves programming,
she makes apps, games, and these incredible luxury desktop applications.

During design, you watch her extracting colors from nature photography,
and the user interface looks so candy like, so fascinating.

---

Just imagine having this little bit of knowledge, as if it were a seed,
and here, is what a real lecture, real knowledge, real school does for you.

You choose to learn more about powerful, desktop applications,
such as those you can make with electron, svelte and sveltvet or sveltestrap.

And for a few days, hour by hour, you keep learning,
you keep consuming, inhaling, discovering, absorbing.

This thing that you really want,
you answer the desire, to at he very least get to coloring bootstrap themes.

---

There are no grades here, no threats, just your ravenous mind,
inheriting, importing, requiring, extending, transpiling…

Look at yourself hurrying home after school,
to take what you have learned, the colorful notes you scribbled.

And plug it into the program,
you already have sitting on __your__ desktop.

Sometimes you can’t come to school, there is no time, only code,
your teacher will see you pushing new commits, it is all right.

You finish your first reference implementation,
and immediately begin working on 2.0.

Then you branch out, to cover more, and follow more tangents,
there is graduation, and job offers, but you just keep learning.

Then you are at your best, you don’t even care how you compare,
you know, you are a hurricane, a wild fire, you are a force of nature.

---

Please, understand, that nothing other than this,
is real education.

If it does not move you, it is irrelevant,
it is in an impossible sequence, at the wrong pace, and at the wrong time.

Real education is you accepting yourself,
as a cosmic entity, and transcending all limits and boundaries.

Navigating complexity like a star-ship captain,
with scarcely a care for maps, because there is only the future.

---

Along with this kind of incredible and consuming motion forward,
you must look past mere knowledge, talent, and resulting wisdom.

And understand, that to grow up, means to grow all the way up,
until you rise to stand as a great being that will make your elder-self proud.
