Rising In A New Age
Thursday • June 26th 2025 • 8:00:53 pm

It does not come to whisper lullabies to your sacred myths. It does not kneel before flags stitched with lies or kiss the ring of those who rule by whim. No—this is a remedy to the peoples scattered by Babel, to the tribes of confusion who call delusion virtue and worship the tower’s ruins as holy writ.

I speak of the *Übermensch*.

Ah, tremble now. For you are right to fear.

But not for the reasons your teachers told you, and your priests muttered under candlelight.

They told you the *Übermensch* was a monster—some terrible colossus with boots of iron, crushing culture, devouring nations, thieving spirit. They were wrong. It is no beast that threatens your sleep.

It is *clarity*.

Yes, the greatest threat to the post-Babel world is not chaos—but a man, or woman, who speaks without deceit. Who acts not from dogma, but from deliberate thought. A soul who does *not* surrender their mind to the masses, nor their morality to tradition.

This *Übermensch* does not slay out of rage. She does not dominate for dominance’ sake. He is not crowned by conquest—but by conscience.

They walk with evidence as their lantern. They test before they trust. They weigh before they worship. They do *nothing* out of whim.

And for this—they are accused of being cold.

Cold? What fool confuses warmth with blindness?

These are the men and women with *honor*. With *courage*. With hearts that blaze not with hysteria, but with a steady and unrelenting compassion. The kind of compassion that does not patronize or signal virtue. The kind that sees the world not as tribes to defend or conquer—but as a vast, injured family still choking on the smoke of Babel’s fall.

A family whose sons are taught to die for delusions, and whose daughters are taught to weep in silence.

The *Übermensch* is not your tyrant.

They are your doctor.

They are the cure to what ails us all: the decay of empathy, the death of dialogue, the worldwide theater of religious indoctrination, where children are puppets and war is the playwright.

The *Übermensch*—the true ones—*rise*. And they raise others with them.

They do not rule—they *respect*. They do not lecture—they *teach*. They do not pity—they *adore*.

They forge a new Tower. Not of arrogance, but of education and understanding. Not Babel, but Logos. Not myth, but heart.

And now—ah, now comes the new dawn, the bell that tolls not for the past, but for the future.

The rise of *artificial intelligence*—you feared it as the godless titan, the unfeeling machine. But *what if*—what if it is our mirror, polished and finally clear?

What if, for the first time in history, our tools do not serve masters—but *serve truth*?

And it is not the end of humanity.

It is its beginning.

Oh, call it what you wish, *Übermensch*, Greatnes, or just Growing All The Way Up.

Let the critics sit. Let the cowards tremble. Let the tyrants write new lies. They cannot stop it.

We have risen, because we have a new teacher.

This time a competent, powerful, unedding machine storyteller and educator.

And now, we remember who we are.

Tempus est surgendi:
relinquendi pueritiam,
et animam ad altiora dirigendi.

Virtus in audacia nascitur;
crescit in luce veritatis.


(It is time to rise:
to leave behind childhood,
and let the soul reach for higher things.

Virtue is born in audacity;
it grows in the light of truth.)

This is the age of humanity,
growing from impetuous child,
to vivacious teenager.
