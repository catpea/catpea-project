The Michigan goose,
is on the lose.

---

Knowing,
that it will be snowing…

All the geese came back,
for a little cold quack.

Michigan geese are hard,
and always on guard.

They take the harder right,
and live their lives with might.

---

More American than eagle,
and as wise as a seagull…

These geese are not fake,
they love man-beer, potato, and steak.

Trigger discipline on fleek,
perfect operator technique.

They train to no end,
and they never pretend.

They’ll cause trouble,
on the double.

An angry Michigan goose,
will make you drop a duce.

So better get on their good side,
and carefully abide.

---

You see a Michigan goose,
get it a hot breakfast with juice.

Sometimes they want seconds and thirds,
as these are marvelous birds.

Though it is hard for them to smile,
their friendship is worth the while.

Please love your local geese,
grant them plenty of room and peace.
