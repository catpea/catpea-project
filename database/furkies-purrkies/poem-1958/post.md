Schools are shifting strategy,
that precise translation of needs into code is no longer needed.

They were never able to teach,
schools were the real slop.

Precise instructions are now needed more than ever,
AI is only good at popular things.

So while AI generates brilliant code,
that will teach popular wisdom.

You still have to take that,
learn and upgrade it.

AI is “scared” of reactive programming,
where variables announce their changes as it causes confusion.

Today AI aims to deliver working code,
and reactive programming is risky for AI.

The old well established patterns,
are more reliable than, the most brilliant modern code.

The old code ideas,
are more compatible with one another.

The old code is wise,
but not as powerful.

Schools do not fit into this discussion,
it is a money grab, in return for an impression of education.

The students who become successful,
were the self driven ones that were going to be successful anyway.

When a school says, we need to change because of AI,
they are looking for a new scam.

They will stop revolving around education,
now that AI can teach better than they ever did.

And focus on building up their brand,
pumping up the importance of the diploma.

I tested a Research feature that my current AI comes with,
and it projects that I can earn almost $10,000,000 per year.

Now, I don’t take it seriously, I consider it a complement,
but, the [report is sturdy][research], it scanned hundreds of web pages.

435 sources it said,
it took 5 minutes and 16 seconds to generate.

It gave realistic estimates, the prices are OK,
for a well funded and advertised startup.

But the big thing is,
it is more realistic than a promise of education, from a brand name school.

Whose only value, is about to become that diploma, and brand name,
not the teaching, that now any AI can handle with ease.

I asked for embedding AI into a browser,
and it said you don’t need that, just use a node module… of course.

Asking the AI to make a requirements document for any of the paragraphs,
will create instructions that lesser AI will follow.

It will result in a little project, that will create executable,
that you can put behind a credit card payment.

The code, wont be ahead of its time,
but it will be wise, and functional, a thing to stand on.

Asking for Bootstrap, or [bootswatch][1],
will result in a neat looking UI, to boot.
