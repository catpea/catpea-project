**I. The Inheritance**

You were handed a broken map
and told it was the only road—
so you handed it down, still torn,
still leading nowhere worth arriving.

You were taught to sit, to comply, to forget
the questions burning in your throat,
and when your children began to ask,
you taught them silence was safer than truth.

This is not your fault alone,
but it became your fault
the moment you stopped asking
whether the inheritance was worth keeping.

---

**II. The Bargain**

You traded their wonder for security,
their fire for a pension,
their "why" for "because I said so,"
their becoming for mere surviving.

You called it love—
this slow flattening,
this gentle suffocation
wrapped in good intentions.

You feared their hunger
because yours was never fed,
and starving people
do not trust abundance.

But your fear is not their fate
unless you make it so.

---

**III. The Delegation**

You gave them to the institution
like offerings to a temple
whose gods you never believed in
but were too tired to question.

Eight hours a day, they sat
learning obedience dressed as knowledge,
conformity dressed as achievement,
silence dressed as respect.

And when they came home empty,
you blamed them for not trying,
never asking what the system
was designed to produce.

It was never designed for greatness.
It was designed for compliance.
And you, weary, let it have them
because the fight seemed too large.

---

**IV. The Mirror**

Look at what you worship:
comfort over meaning,
safety over truth,
approval over integrity.

Your children learned to worship it too.
They learned it from your silences,
from your careful avoidances,
from every time you chose the easy lie.

They learned that adults
do not believe their own words,
that principles are decorations,
that the soul is negotiable.

You taught them this
without saying a word.
Children are scholars
of what we actually do.

---

**V. The Unlived Life**

The dreams you buried
did not stay buried.
They rose up in your children
as the same longing you abandoned.

And when you saw that light in them—
that terrible, beautiful fire—
you reached for water,
calling it wisdom, calling it protection.

But it was fear.
Fear that they might succeed
where you surrendered.
Fear that they might prove
it was possible all along.

So you clipped wings
and called it teaching them to walk.

---

**VI. The System You Serve**

They needed Socrates.
You gave them test prep.

They needed to know why humans suffer
and what makes life worth living.
You gave them grades and rankings
and the terror of falling behind.

They needed to be *seen*—
their particular genius honored,
their specific struggles met.
You gave them to a machine
that cannot see anything
but average.

And when the machine
returned them broken,
you blamed the child
for not fitting the mold.

---

**VII. The Conspiracy of Silence**

You knew.

You knew the schools were failing.
You knew the tests measured nothing that matters.
You knew the homework was busywork.
You knew the spirit was being crushed.

You knew, and you said nothing,
because everyone else said nothing,
and silence is so much easier
than being the one who speaks.

Your children needed a defender.
They got a collaborator.

---

**VIII. The Abdication**

You were their first teacher,
their first window to the world,
their first evidence
of what humanity could be.

And you outsourced it.

To screens that teach them
they are not enough.
To systems that teach them
they are interchangeable.
To cultures that teach them
consumption is meaning.

You had the sacred task
of forming a soul,
and you treated it
like an inconvenience
to be managed.

---

**IX. What They Needed**

They needed you to fight—
not for their comfort,
but for their becoming.

They needed you to question
every authority that demanded
their submission without earning
their respect.

They needed you to say:
*My child is not a product.*
*My child is not a score.*
*My child is not raw material
for someone else's economy.*

They needed you to be
the adult you wished you'd had—
the one who saw the fire
and fed it.

---

**X. The Reckoning**

Now they sit in rooms
scrolling through emptiness,
wondering why they feel
like strangers to themselves.

Now they have credentials
but no convictions,
information but no wisdom,
opinions but no foundation.

Now they are afraid
to want anything too much,
to believe anything too deeply,
to become anything too fully.

This is the harvest
of seeds you did not know
you were planting.

But you planted them
with every silence,
every surrender,
every well-meaning betrayal.

---

**XI. The Door That Remains**

And yet—

The soul is stubborn.
It does not die easily.
Beneath the rubble of
fake education and distraction,
something still breathes.

Your children still hunger
for what they were denied.
They still dream of lives
that mean something.

The fire you tried to drown
is not dead.
It is waiting.

---

**XII. The Call**

So now, what will you do?

Will you keep serving
the gods that failed you?
Will you keep offering your children
to systems that do not love them?

Or will you become, even now,
even late,
the parent you were meant to be—

The one who says:
*I was wrong.*
*I was afraid.*
*But I am not afraid anymore.*

The one who chooses,
finally, to fight
for what matters most.

---

**XIII. The Truth**

You cannot unbuild
what has been built.
But you can stop building
on rotten foundations.

You can stop lying
about what you value.
You can stop pretending
the system serves your children
when it serves only itself.

You can begin, today,
to tell them the truth:

*The world is broken.
And I helped break it.
But you—
you can be part of healing it.
And I will help you now,
instead of standing in your way.*

---

**XIV. The Covenant**

Every child born
is a question the universe asks:
*Will you honor this?
Will you serve this becoming?*

Most of us answer
with cowardice and convenience.
We answer with delegation and distraction.
We answer by looking away.

But the question does not disappear.
It lives in every struggling student,
every over-medicated child,
every young person who has forgotten
how to want.

The question is still being asked.

How will you answer now?

Will you help your children to grow,
so that someday they may grow all they way up,
and become great beings...
