Muscles Like A Chimpanzee, But Is This Really The Right Look For Me?
Friday • July 26th 2024 • 12:59:47 am

It all started with my noodle noggin,
some weeks after I took up jogging.

After much huff and puff,
I noticed that my legs got pretty buff.

I was like - Ah Ha! - I knew it!
this is how the bodybuilder do it.

---

Nice and long sustain,
muscle strain.

---

Of course everyone will disagree,
with me.

Go ahead, if you dare,
ask me if I care.

I lift dumbbells non stop,
front, and bottom, and top.

My exercise three hours long,
and I do stick out like I don’t belong.

But that has always been the case,
I always kept to my own space.

---

But because I never lay or rest,
I don’t have much of a gorilla chest.

But I am almost ready to test,
bench press, instead of rest.

I think it will work,
and I wont’ feel like a dork.

Laying down for the main workout,
is just not my route.

---

So first I closed the rest gaps,
like joggers do in their laps.

For me non stop is the only way,
and it does not matter what anyone will say.

I started with tree pounds per hand,
and increased to what my body could withstand.

While adding an extra hour and then two,
once I thought I could push through.

---

I am forced to stop every song or so,
but that’s only to help the blood flow.

My muscles don’t really get tired,
and work as required.

And it is trail-mix that serves,
my constantly replenishing energy reserves.

I am now up to 20 pounds,
but those are slow rounds.

So I lift faster some 2 pounds less,
to burn up my fat excess.

I switched to faster songs and dance a bit,
and I feel a lot more fit.

---

Just building the muscle,
like some kind of a castle…

May not be that great,
especially if you need to lose fat weight.

And hopping around is a great way to stretch,
and break through that plateau edge.

---
To be clear, Just so that you know,
the only way to instruct your body to grow.

The very idea a the bodybuilding core...
Is to always challenge it a tiny-litte-bit more!
