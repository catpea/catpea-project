You have to start by lifting 3 pound dumbbells,
for 15 minutes, learn to walk a few steps, back and forth .

Make sure that your whole body is moving,
the dumbbells affect your entire musculature.

Your biceps may not get much at first,
but you shoulders and legs will.

Don't worry is three pounds is too light,
but you can switch to five, even if for a time.

---

Work on your biceps,
lift dumbbells above your head.

Lift them even odd,
so that your muscles are not locked.

Be like water,
stay flexible.

---

Once you can workout for fifteen minutes,
with very light dumbbells.

Figure out how long you have to rest,
to do it again, and add another 15 minutes.

Let us call it a round,
you will add a round.

So if you need to rest,
for ten minutes.

It will be 15 minutes of dumbells, 10 minutes of rest,.
And 15 minutes of dumbells again.

When you can handle that,
add another round.

This will make for 45 minutes of working out,
and 20 minutes of resting.

Dumbbells, rest, dumbbells rest, dumbbells,
go home.

---

As you add more rounds, take care of your music,
and lift to the beat of slow songs.

This induces a dance trance,
that makes the workout feel like just a few minutes.

---

Now you have to attack your rest period,
the way joggers eliminate needing to stop.

You will be working out a minute longer,
and resting a minute less.

Until you don't have to rest anymore,
this is called increasing your endurance.

---

Now that you are working out for about an hour,
you will have to increase your movement speed.

You will need to listen to faster music,
and begin twisting and turning a little bit.

Dance is what made warriors strong in battle,
and I recommend a few safe shuffle dancing moves.

---

Finally, because there is not much more to it,
as it is just lifting after all.

Increase the weight of your dumbbells,
to five pounds, eight pounds, ten pounds, twelve pounds, and fifteen.

Your body has its own adaptation speed,
so be respectful, but lean into the discomfort.

---

Workout every day,
take weekends off if you must.

Triple your workout duration if you must burn fat,
or just add a second hour once you hit a plateau.

---

And if gym is not for you,
walk the triple crown.

The Appalachian, Pacific Crest,
and Continental Divide Trails.

---

And if the instructions still seem unclear,
please put the potato down.
