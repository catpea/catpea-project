You were never dumb,
that was just a way to keep you quiet.

The teacher kept you scared,
and made you feel stupid.

So that they din;'t have to work very hard,
so that they didn't actually had to teach.

They got paid either way,
so they chose tricking you into memeorization.

As on tests, it is indistingishable from,
actual comprehension.

Eadh time you pretended to learn.
knowlwge was stolen fro you.

---

Each time you memorize something,
even if you remember it… knowledge is stolen from you.

A single theft,
can collapse you r entire body of knowledge.

For example, not understanding division,
leads to a weak understanding of ratios.

Leads to merely memorizing percent formula,
which blocks you from doing number domain translations.

Which will turn you away from computers,
because you need ratios to mage fun animations.

You need to translate,
the width of something you drew on grid paper.

To the screen,
which is in a variable number of pixels,

Withut computers, you will be forced into debt,
stress, overwork, tiredness.

And often miss out on laugher, creativity,
spontaneous displays of magic.

And generally being silly,
and acting half your age.

---

The teacher coerces you into memorization,
becasu3e they can’t teach every student one by one.

They only do enough to bring a paycheck home,
you classroom is already divided in 1/3a, 1/3b, 1/3c…

And 0.1 the wrath,
the three kids in the back.

Who can see the teacher is lying,
but have been cut of by parents, threats and ridicule.

---

The motive, is thanking that little paycheck home,
don’t let the teacher trick you, it is a nice job.

It takes a particular kind of person,
to fake it until they make it, and coerce you into memorization.

---

Begin experimenting with artificial intelligence immediately,
your entire future has been sold, with you in the middle.

You need multiple comprehensions of the same things,
otherwise called genius, and never memorization.

Memorization is a virus for your knowledge,
that will destroy your future.

---

Search the internet for [awesome lists][0],
usually you search for “awesome ai”, or "awesome llm".

These are simple text lists of links to key places,
here you will discover ollama, and its models.

It is a simple way of getting a private AI on your computer,
you won’t need to worry about membership fees.

---

Ideally, you want to build a WikiWiki based school,
one that allows for self directed education.

For you and the countless many that come afterwards,
you must learn to explain things visually.

Hence, number domin translation,
animation is a way way to teach in a more profound way.

This is nicely demonstrated by [3blue1brown][1],
but the world needs more than just a singe animation.

People of different backgrounds, with different knowledge,
and even different speed of learning, need different paths.

A school is extremely hard to build,
that is why the wold only got as far as ineffective shared education with fraudulent teachers.

But without education,
large parts of the world will be susceptible to indoctrination.

And wars, which make a far greater profit than fake education,
will never stop.

---

In closing, you are meant to grow all they way up and become a great being,
a protector of this world.

Worrying about grades, that could never be honest,
is a really bad start.

You have to understand that you are fully capable of great genius,
and use artificial intelligence to self educate.

So that no-one uses you or anybody else as cog in their low effort profit machine,
ever again.

Please,
begin learning for real.


Child, make it clear that their good enough,
is never going to be good enough for you.

---

Afterword,
if you went too far, if you ncan no longer stop pretending.

If you just can’t tell the difference between fake and autehntic,
let the philosophers come to your rescule.

Prepare to take a break from alll the lies,
and eventually walk the Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide Trails.

Walk the triple crown,
with every philosophy book ever written playing in your ear.

The world does not need followers,
it does not need cogs, or inauthentic leaders.

The world needs you to grow all the way up,
so that never again will you ever be ruled by false leaders.
