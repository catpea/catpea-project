An Invitation To A Great Quest, With A Preface By Abraham Lincoln
Friday • October 18th 2024 • 11:23:12 pm

My fellow citizens,

Today, as we gather here in the enduring spirit of unity, let us lend our hearts and ears to the timeless whispers of ancient spirits, for they share truths as enduring as the land we stand upon: the indelible wisdom and undying liberty that belong to each of us by divine design.

Picture, if you will, the majestic creature of folklore—a fox blessed with nine splendid tails. In that creature's graceful dance of unity, we find our own strength. Each tail stands as a pillar of virtue, offering justice, compassion, courage, humility, integrity, perseverance, kindness, wisdom, and hope. Together, they form a powerful force, one that beckons us to unite in virtue and purpose.

Each soul in this great nation harbors an inner animal—a reflection of our truest strengths and aspirations. This spirit yearns to guide us all, to stride together toward the bright horizon of harmony and understanding. In the depths of my own heart, I hold a dream—a vision of our world united— by threads of liberty and the pursuit of wisdom, crossing all borders, welcoming all the world's people.

Awaken your inner beasts, my dear compatriots. Let them roar with the raw potential that resides within. Together, let us channel this energy to blaze a trail toward a world united in peace and wisdom. Imagine, if you will, a symphony of nations—each voice rising in harmony, each one dedicated to the noble pursuit of knowledge, compassion, and shared humanity's greatness.

Understand this truth, my friends: to discover your inner animal is to find your greatest ally. Let its instincts guide you as we embark on this collective journey, to forge a new path brimming with compassion and enlightenment. Let us devote ourselves to crafting a world where understanding illuminates every action, transforming each citizen into a beacon of peace and prosperity.

Seek your tail, your guiding star, for it is in the dance of our unique spirits that we uncover the rhythm of unity. Each heartbeat—a call to harness our strength for the greater good of humanity. A true union is more than a political construct; it is the gathering of souls, united in the quest for wisdom, bound by the belief that greatness is a birthright bestowed upon us all.

... merely see you as residents.

If you just stay in this tiny world,
until you are nothing but old.

They’ll help you retire,
and find a new hire.

And you’ll just die,
like a little fly.

---

“The gods of our ancestors call us to rise above the shadows of injustice, to honor the sacred bond between all living things.”

---

What is the big deal,
and how can you heal.

Your uniqueness inconvenient to all,
and all hope it will collapse and fall.

When you start dressing up like an ancient god,
they instinctive know it will reveal their fraud.

Why the next thing you’ll do,
is listen to a philosophy book book or two.

---

“In the heart of every creature, there lies a spark of the divine. To enslave one is to extinguish a flame meant to shine brightly.”

---

A good conspiracy,
is not a voting democracy.

It is an opportunistic networked fraud,
with a imaginary god.

Where you work to death,
selling your final breath.

They forced you to be born pure,
and bait you to endure.

In your ineducation,
their low effort economy will sustain a nation.

---

“The chains that bind a man bind the very soul of humanity. We must break them, not just for the oppressed, but for the freedom of all.”

---

I don’t have to tell you what you are,
to people that think thy own you.

And that, is what is so spooky,
about you wearing something kooky.

It is a sign that you are not in their control,
that their hopes and lied never worked at all.

And if you so dare to wear a tail that touches the ground,
all year round.

You will be discard and thrown away,
metamorphosed into a cast away and stray.

---

"True power lies not in dominion over others, but in the courage to stand against the darkness that seeks to divide us."

---

Damned to walk the great trails,
dragging all of your divine tails.

Earning your triple crown,
without ever backing down.

The Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Divide
will help you become a force of nature and a guide.

As your resume gaps,
encourage your to learn programming, perhaps.

A thousands days on the trail,
is a thousand years for a snail.

When you return from your quest,
your future will be blessed.

Your life spun out of control,
you will begin learning all.

You will never age,
never fit in a cage.
