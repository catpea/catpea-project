You have to lift what you can almost non-stop,
for as long as you are willing to be at the gym.

Duration of your exercise, elimination of rest,
and that your exercise engages many muscles throughout.

Is far more important,
than the weight that you are lifting.

---

Imagine being given the responsibility,
for training a group of soldiers.

Who in a few years,
will go into battle.

---

You have a gym all to yourselves,
fully stocked fully equipped.

---

Would you dare,
to recommend muscle isolation.

Sitting on some machine,
where movement is restricted and unnatural.

A soldier does not need 8 muscles,
and a weak back.

---

Would you ask them to lift their maximum,
where they cut off their circulation.

Where muscles may actually get tired.
They certainly demand down time.

And is so, how are you going to get those,
who are lifting 30 pounds for biceps.

To leap into 35 pounds,
something that they can only maybe lift once and not well.

How are you going to help them advance,
when heavy weight forces them to stop after less than a minute?

Are they not going to plateau,
because they just can’t lift more.

And what about their back, abdominal,
legs, shoulders.

And the overall musculature,
that must all be in harmony to move?

---

Surely, you don’t believe,
that if they just keep lifting 35 pounds for a few seconds.

Anything will,
change.

---

And they are human,
and humans get bored.

You don’t want them to turn around,
and give you a workout, do you?

---

And if you start them at 35,
let them tire, and move them to 30, and down.

Why did you, tire them first,
why didn’t you give them a chance to lift lighter for longer.

And would it not make sense,
to have them cycle various dumbbell exercises.

So that when one muscle group gets tired,
they can switch to another without distraction.

Why would you interrupt their exercise,
by telling them to move to a different machine.

Let them focus on the beats of music,
and move dumbbells to the side, above, infront, and curl.

Music will put them into a dance trance,
so as long as it is slow enough not to max them out.

---

Now look at your soldiers,
they come in, and lift dumbbells, non stop.

Meaning they have to start in the beginning,
with five pounds, ladies rack, as they have wiser increments.

And just as soon,
as one of your soldiers can handle adding in 7.5 section.

Le them start replacing large portion of their 5 pound run,
with 7.5 pounds, as their body lets them.

Double the duration of their exercise in the same way,
just as soon as they are not tired at the end, add an hour.

If they are fat, gently speed up the tempo of the music,
give them a new playlist.

If they are skinny, slow the music down,
and let them begin lifting 10 pounds, non-stop for two or more hours.

---

Do you see what is happening,
they are becoming able to lift more, to work harder.

Because the duration of their lifting,
has such a profound impact on their body.

It is not enough to make the body stop,
but it is enough to keep pushing it.

Their actual lifting duration went from,
three minutes per hour.

To 120 or even 180 minutes per hour,
similar to joggers, but they keep lifting more.

---

Lifting heavy stops a person from adaptation,
it just depletes them, it hurts them.

Lifting light, opens up many doors,
there is the constant adding of weight…

But also extending duration of their lifting,
you can’t do that to someone who lifts heavy.

A person who lift heavy,
has no path towards gradually lifting heavier.

Five pound increments a the gym
are way too much, they are five times too heavy.

Now twisting and turning with dumbbells,
will tune the for lifting with less injury.

And controlling the tempo of music,
is another control nob you get is you lift light.

---

Our bodies can adapt but slowly,
when they receive constant reminders.

They will not adapt,
from lifting heavy 30 times.

And they will absolutely not adapt,
if you lift the same amount of weight, the same amount of time.

They enter a plateau,
that guarantees less and less about lifting more and more.

---

Finally, you can do your max exercises in your free time,
they will see improvement from lifting lighter for longer.

But the most important thing here is a fully functional,
distraction free full body exercise that does not stop you.

And don’t worry about the wall after thew hours,
that too is a trick to discourage you.

Switch your diet to soaked soft trail-mix.
and as you slowly digest you food.

Your digestive system will be constantly,
re-charging your muscles.

---

The more you learn about lifting lighter for extended duration,
the more upgrades and techniques will reveal themselves.

Please, stop lifting heavy,
get hopped up on trail-mix and dance with dumbbells for two hours a day.

At first slow and light,
but then adjusting tempo, weights and overall duration.

Because with so much control,
you are guaranteed to meet your goals.
