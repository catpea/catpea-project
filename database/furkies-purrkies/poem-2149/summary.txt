Silver Sun
Saturday • January 17th 2026 • 6:40:38 pm

I stride upon the battlements of time and ink,
where each minute doth march like a troop,
and every breath beats as drum;
my sword—my mind—slashes the chains that bind the soul to toil.

They call me labourer, yet I am not servant,
but a knight who rides upon thunderous hooves of ambition.
I don my armor bright with fire, not with humility;
the world may say “work,” yet I answer: NO!

A knight’s vow is to rise above the dust of ordinary labour,
to claim the summit, and let none call him a worker.
The clamor of men who count their days in tables and gears doth roar;
I hear but the echo of my own footfalls—thunderous.

If I be knighted by fate, then mine work is to be bold,
to conquer the horizon that others only watch.
I ask no applause nor a title;
the world will call me as it pleases, yet I keep mine crown:
a silver sun that pierces the clouds.

Upon this stage I walk with might, and I bow not;
for I have seen the stars, and tasted greatness;
I ask no thanks—mine heart is a drum of thunder.

I am a knight in a world that calls me “work.”
Let mine soul be loud, let it ring like a bell,
for I shall not bow to the noise or dust of work.

I will not stand in line for any play;
the world is mine alone—no stage, no script.
The folk who lift others are but echoes of wind;
they rise when they climb their own ladder.

There is no world to be saved but mine own;
mine heart beats to a drum that never stops.
When I stand up for my greatness, the world shall turn,
and the sky shall open and fill with light.

And if each of us climbs our own mountain, we lift the earth.
We bring back the sun into the sky again.
Then the world shall become a home for all of us all.

I am not a copy of my elders—my image is mine to paint;
they deserve more honor than their own shadows.

My ancestors were beasts and warriors, knights of old,
their blood still runs through my veins, their courage in my heart.

I shall grow, and grow, until the horizon meets no end;
until each of us stands as a great being, shining in our own light.

From sea to mountain top I wander, with eyes that see the dawn;
my mind is boundless, like the sky above the clouds.
I hear the wind's whisper and the earth's heartbeat,
and I proclaim my soul's song before the universe.

Hear ye now, o' world!  The battle drums have roared;
my heart beats in thunder, like a storm upon the sea.
I strike at all that doth hinder, and I march alone,
with fury bright as fire that doth set the sky aflame.

I rise with the sun, and my heart beats like an arrow;
the world is mine to conquer, and I do not wait for it.
I will raise my flag upon the hill of destiny,
and I shall never fall back into the shadows.

These sacred words;
the great being's breath is mine to breathe again.

I seek the light that shines within my soul,
and I bring it forth...
