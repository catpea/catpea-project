Listening to narrated non-fiction books,
serves as a good diagnostic of your mind.

If you can’t understand a book that is being whispered in your ear,
if it gets tangled up, if you can’t focus, if you can’t understand anything…

Then that means you are not in a normal state of mind,
it means you are in the wrong state of mind, and you should make effort to recover.

A wrong state of mind is not an illness, it is simply wrong,
and it means a person should aim towards recovery.

All great beings put themselves through some hardships to achieve,
but it is important to always return to a normal state of mind.

The worst thing that happens is passage of time at an accelerated rate,
and as the opening lines states, falling behind on self education.

---

Recovery is greatly aided, by a person’s level of knowledge and wisdom,
which can only come from books that are captivating enough to punch through any state.

These are usually adventure books, that contain both joy,
and share the adventurers class, greatness, knowledge and wisdom.

When we inherit beautiful thoughts, ideas, and wisdom,
our recovery from living in wrongs states of mind will take us higher.

---

The key to beginning a recovery is so simple,
that it almost seems ridiculous, and certainly strange.

It is a several months long vacation, that frankly, unfairly,
starts weeks up to two weeks of severe debilitating doubt.

The first three days, are the worst,
the moment it occurs to you...

That your boss has been calling,
because you didn’t come back from your two week vacation.

You whole body, will feel wrong, and you will want to run back,
crawl into the toxic existence that was limiting your mind.

You must view it as the toxicity that was absorbed by your body,
leaving you, making its last ditch effort, to keep you in the wrong state.

---

After the first few days, after the first few weeks,
doubt will turn to a kind of restrained anger.

As by that time, you will understand,
that a wrong state, is like a prison for your mind.

---

It is important that you take your vacation in a beautiful place,
you can’t recover from overwork by checking into a motel shack in a concrete jungle.

Likewise, you won’t recover well, if you head towards an annoying tourist trap,
full of shallow retires that never noticed the prison around their head.

The most beautiful places, are probably found on the great trails,
though they maybe well traveled, the adventurers there will be in the right state of mind.

I think being able to see the mountains, or the ocean, or endless lakes,
is also very important for recovery.

That infinite kind of scenery,
helps our minds unwind.

---

Finally, upon your recovery, consider helping the younger generations,
create a two hour narrated book.

Ensure, it has a beautiful cover,
beautiful photography and typography.

Give it away as a free download,
self publish a leather bound signed version, maybe.

You don’t have to speak about your recovery to the younger generation,
just your younger self.

It is tradition, not to seek success as a writer while we have better things to do,
but we can be sure, that Humanity will be around for long enough…

To read all its wise books,
countless, many times, over.
