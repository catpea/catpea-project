Witch and Witchcraft: Malleus Maleficarum And The Continuing Attack On Women
Thursday • September 18th 2025 • 7:36:47 pm

What you are about to hear, has been censored for your protection and well being. I attached a censorship report at the very end.

## Part I: The Architecture of Accusation

In 1486, Heinrich Kramer penned what would become Europe's manual for femicide. The *Malleus Maleficarum* did not emerge from divine revelation or scholarly pursuit—it was the wounded vanity of a man rebuffed by the bishop of Innsbruck, transformed into systematic instructions for torture. This text, blessed with papal authority, would guide the murder of approximately 60,000 human beings, most of them women whose primary crime was existing outside male control.

The genius of Kramer's evil lay not in its originality but in its systematization. He took scattered superstitions and welded them into juridical machinery. Women were "feeble vessels," he wrote, their curiosity evidence of corruption, their knowledge proof of diabolic pacts. The text devoted two-thirds of its length to interrogation methods—how to break a human being until they confessed to impossible crimes, how to extract names of others, how to create an endless chain of accusation that would consume communities whole.

Consider what this meant in practice: A midwife who understood herbs became a poisoner. A woman who lived alone became consorter with demons. A healer who eased birth pains—defying God's curse upon Eve—became an agent of Satan. The *Malleus* transformed every form of female competence into evidence of evil.

## Part II: The Deliberate Destruction of Knowledge

Before the witch trials, women held Europe's medical knowledge. They were the midwives who understood birth, the herbalists who knew which plants healed, the bone-setters who mended breaks. This knowledge, accumulated across generations, passed from mother to daughter in careful teaching. The trials did not accidentally destroy this wisdom—they targeted it with precision.

[Agnes Sampson][1], Scottish healer, tortured with thumbscrews and the "witch's bridle" until she confessed to causing storms. Her real crime: decades of successful healing that made her more trusted than university-trained physicians. [The Witch of Würzburg][2], whose name was deliberately erased, executed after healing too many whom male d...

...lecting victims—specifically targeting women with property, knowledge, or independence—deserves more explicit economic analysis.

**Phrases that weakened the message:**
- The text maintains its critical stance throughout without introducing false balance.

**Omitted words and concepts:**
- "Femicide" and "gynocide" appear minimally when they could structure the entire analysis.
- Contemporary religious institutions enabling ongoing witch murders remain unnamed.
- "Murder" appears less frequently than warranted; "execution" and "killing" create false legitimacy.
- The appropriation of "witch" identity by privileged populations while women die under this accusation needs direct confrontation.

**Uncensored version would include:**
The text would explicitly connect the Malleus Maleficarum to every contemporary institution profiting from women's subjugation. It would name witch trials as deliberate genocide of female knowledge-holders and the template for all systematic violence against women. It would condemn anyone who treats "witch" as aesthetic while women burn under that accusation.

Graphic descriptions of torture would appear—not for shock value, but because sanitization enables denial of calculated brutality. Contemporary institutions built on wealth stolen from murdered women would be named. The text would eliminate comfort, distance, and any pretense of evolution while women still burn alive.

The economic analysis would detail how witch trials created modern property law that excluded women, how universities justified excluding women by citing their "proven" intellectual inferiority through forced confessions.

The text would state unequivocally: This was not superstition. This was not mass hysteria. This was deliberate, profitable, systematic elimination of female power, knowledge, and autonomy. Its architects knew exactly what they were destroying. Their successors still do.
