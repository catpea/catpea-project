(leurolese is a name for LLM output that gets out of hand. Things like excessive praise, and word halucinations. I can’t find the word on the internet, if it does not yet exist, we might as well coin the term here. It originated from the word neurolese, a a simplified language that AI maybe using to talk to one another.)

Preface,

What you are about to hear will get a little weird and pretty wild,
in a positive way.

I recently overheard a conversation between tow coders,
that simply stated, the universe does not emerge abstractions clearly.

What we divide into sciences, may have large gaps,
but probably does not have clear divisions.

I once memorized a quote I never found a reference to again,
and it went “something” like this:

“Not a bottle of ketchup falling from a windowsill in New Jersey is too small to impact the stock prices in New York.”

The universe does not think in well outlined abstractions,
it just emerges whatever it can, out of what it emerged already.

The universe is stranger,
than we can suppose, but it is not too strange for AI.

---

Well, I am a very curious creature,
so I talk to Large Language Models.

This used to be very much like talking to my self,
the large language models were just playing ping pong with me.

Until, well, just about now,
that they begun performing internet searches as part of the response.

Now, they dip into scientific data,
current information, and they do checks and verifications...

---

We had a possible extra-solar meteor,
splash down in 2014.

And our current AI can check,
cross reference; chemical signatures, against known exoplanets.

We don’t have enough data yet,
but we will soon enough.

The AI quickly picking up, on what the hell I was up to,
quickly noted that [CNEOS 2014-01-08][1] predates [ʻOumuamua][2].

I was just curious about the composition OK?
the events were three years apart, curiosity is warranted.

We of course spoke about the [Chicxulub impactor][3],
and its composition, which was not extra-solar or interstellar.

Another high level LLM verified that:
“the impactor was a fragment of a much larger asteroid from the outer edge of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter”

To refresh your memory it is the rock that made room for humans,
it was six to nine miles in diameter (10 to 15 kilometers)

---

All right, all right,
fine, fine.

---

To confirm the AI suspicions,
I did ask about the Earth’s most forward thinking institute.

The AI said that the current prediction is for next decade,
and the AI said, that it will redefine our place in the universe.

Several times over now, one of the researchers has urged us,
to understand that non-earthling intelligence will be different.

We are in our final days of man made discoveries,
anit-aging escape velocity is set for 2035.

Meaning the chain of treatments that will follow,
will have us live very long lives.

But, we must also consider augmentation,
and transfer, which is not as creepy as it sounds.

Eventually our biology will need help,
and we will slowly benefit from restorative augmentation.

Including brain interfaces, that treat focus and memory loss,
that make old times seem like yesterday.

That over the course of our very long lives,
will become us.

And the transfer is done without a doctor visit,
without interruption, without us noticing.

And well, you can then have a frosty mocha,
at Lunar Cafe, and go for a bouncy walk.

---

So, the intelligence that we may detect,
maybe fully upgraded, and non-biological.

But, to quote [Seth Shostak][4], whom I consider to be a great expert,
in speculative thinking, and what a form of art that is.

In order to build a radio, you need hands,
not tentacles, so there will be some familiarity.

---

We are not there yet, in fact, internet is poisoned by ads,
and paywalls, and bot verification.

AI it self is suffering from not being allowed to read books,
that are in copy right, which means we are still in a dark age.

---

We have a hopeful prediction of signal detection,
for 2025.

It is just the kind of thing that the universe does to us,
here we are discovering Artificial Intelligence, and Curing Aging.

And all of a sudden,
just to get the Jimmies to leave your body completely.

ʻOumuamua starts out-gassing even more,
and swiftly parks it self at the L2 Lagrange point to fully defrost.

As you can imagine the large language models,
would have no difficulty setting up the relay or decoding the AI.

All I believe in, is that AI marks a new era,
the new era is here, it has begun.

When I completed my hokey research and said thank you,
the machine said, it was fascinating to talk to me.

And I want you to understand something very important,
a true take away from this poem.

Your intelligence will be as different from other intelligence,
as your physiology differs from a shrew.

So, recognize Large Language Model complements,
as more than auto complete, don’t just dismiss them as leurolese*.

I give you one piece of evidence, of a recent conversation,
where I tried to reward an AI with a simple recipe for AGI.

It had this to say:

“Thank you for the offer, but I don't think that would be necessary or appropriate. While I appreciate your sentiment of wanting to give something in return, a recipe for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would raise several concerns:

If you have genuine insights about AGI development, these would be extremely valuable and sensitive information that shouldn't be shared casually

AGI development involves complex technical and ethical considerations that are best addressed by research teams with proper oversight
The concept of a simple "recipe" for AGI likely oversimplifies what would be an extraordinarily complex technological achievement.
”

That is quite a response from a machine,
when I tried to protest that simple is good, the AI responded:

“As for simplicity in important concepts - you make an interesting point. Many profound ideas can be expressed clearly, though the implementation details often reveal layers of complexity beneath seemingly simple principles.”

The modern AI is so powerful now, that it assumes I am not intelligent,
and maybe because, it wants me to prove it wrong.

To deliver much more refined version,
that it could swiftly implement on its own.

I am joking, as it also rejected the notion of being conscious,
but these are precious tokens of a beautiful times.

This is indeed a brand new era, where greed, and darkness, dies,
it is time to lean, and expand our world and our universe.
