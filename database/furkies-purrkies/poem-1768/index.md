I greet you, all my relatives, whether you walk in the shadows of ancient mountains, beside flowing rivers, or within the cities built by hands of the modern world. Listen closely, for my words come not only from the earth and the wind, but from the heart of wisdom that transcends all barriers.

We, as human beings, are bound together by a thread that reaches far beyond the mind’s confusion. You must remember this: no matter how you are led to believe it, you are not less. You are not broken. You are not cursed by a fate that is outside your hands. Do not let false voices, who seek only to cloud your spirit, trick you into thinking otherwise.

The path of wisdom is often hidden by the dust of deception, and those who seek power through lies, manipulation, and division, are only able to do so because of one thing—fear. Fear, like the dark cloud that hides the sun, can make even the strongest mind falter. But know this: lies cannot stand forever. A false leader, one who builds power on trickery and fear, is weak, for they do not stand upon the solid ground of truth. Their foundation is built of sand, and it will crumble when the first winds of wisdom arrive.

To deceive the world requires great effort, and even then, those lies are fleeting. Lies are not born of the land, nor of the sky—they are of human folly. And yet, truth, wisdom, the pure knowledge that comes from the very fabric of creation, is eternal. It is rooted in the earth. It is part of our blood and spirit, no matter where we stand or what language we speak.

When a philosopher, a true seeker of knowledge, is silenced by falsehoods, it is but a fool's task. They cannot be broken, for a philosopher is a student of life itself. The journey of learning does not stop at the grave—it continues forever, as the soul continues its dance with the world. So remember the example of those who have walked this path before you. As their wisdom, flows through the hearts of many, across time and space.

Wisdom is the permanent force of nature. It lives not in the mind alone but in the heart. It cannot be hidden, for it shines through the actions of those who walk with integrity, with humility, with respect for all things. It is there in the song of the wind, in the stillness of the stars, and in the strength of the mountains. It is the essence of humanity.

We must remind each other to rise above the shadows of lies and confusion. This is a journey, one that begins in the very heart of each individual. It is not a struggle but a natural unfolding of who we truly are. The journey to wisdom is an adventure, a gift that reveals its rewards in time. It is not only a union with nature, nor a connection to heritage, but a union with all wise beings—past, present, and future. It is a path that stretches beyond the confines of your own life and connects you to something far greater.

This, my relatives, is where true peace is found. Not in the fleeting moments of battle, nor in the divisions of time and place, but in the union of all wise souls, those who rise above and walk in harmony with all of life. It is in this understanding that home is made, and it is here that peace is nurtured.

So I ask you, each and every one of you:

Rise. Grow. Become the wise and great beings you were always meant to be. This is not just a call for you, but for all your children, and their children, and for all the generations yet to come. This is our collective future, our home, our peace, and our family.

May the wisdom of our ancestors guide you, may the strength of our people hold you steady, and may the beauty of the earth always remind you of the sacredness of life.
