The Emergence Of A Complete JavaScript Module: The Terrifyingly Swift End Of Make-Believe Education
Sunday • August 10th 2025 • 7:33:02 pm

Today Artificial Intelligence has generated a complete module,
I called it [yokel][1], as it somewhat sounds like local.

And it is a command modules,
that helps in juggling local JavaScript modules.

Aside from solving a real problem,
what is so magnificent about it, is that it is untouched by human hand.

Not a single character was altered,
the generated module was perfect, and written rather well.

---

It is no longer rational behavior,
to worry about quizzes, grades or GPA.

The Middle School, High School, Community College, University,
is far more unreliable, than learning programming from AI.

For those of you who do not yet completely understand,
the gravity of this skill.

Programming is a structured microscope,
that will visualization and simulation will let you master anything.

From hard or [abstract science with dated notation][2]
to cells, virtual organisms, and shockingly thinking programs.

Thinking is as near as processing Concept Maps with AI agents,
or building virtual text worlds based on adventure games.

---

I am unable to express the gravity of this situation,
the world has not changed, it is new.

No teacher, real or make-believe
has the ability to teach you, on this level.

AI and Programming represents Authentic Education,
where each day, and without a fail you become more powerful.

This power is not an abstract expression,
you actually learn and retain new programming abilities.

With the Artificial Intelligent as Teacher, Friend, and Development Team,
you become unstoppable.

Wi8th Artificial Intelligence helping you finish all the grunt work,
your diagrams haven’t accounted for in mere minutes.

You can master anything,
and program everything.

---

This morning, I closed my eyes to stay in the zone,
there is a problem with an unnecessary utility.

It is only something that fat developers face,
fat as in, I trust no one, I’ll have a local copy of my mojo jojo.

There is really nothing that can help us,
because it is an extra step that replays multiple times, and echoes.

---

So I sequined, and I made my wish,
I think that is what we should call them now.

And the AI, started her dance,
and returned the gift.

I actually said the following:
“This is unfair for computers to do...

----- snip ----- (Sorry, 5,000 letter limit in summaries see catpea.com or visit https://github.com/catpea/ for source-code) ----- snip -----

...dly,
it added colors and a spinner, which I considered excess.

But, I was wrong, I only need it for 5 local packages max,
but, someone could use it for 500, and it makes sense to have progress spinners.

It gave me 360 lines of code,
that would eat my entire day.

It only took an hour, to write my wish,
and go over the results.

And look what it said,
in the README file:


`yokel` automates the traditional npm link workflow:

**Traditional Workflow:**
```
cd ../my-local-package
npm link
cd -
npm link my-local-package
# Manually edit package.json
```

**With yokel:**
```
yokel i ../my-local-package
# Done!
```

Anybody calling AI auto complete,
has issues, they need to address first.

---

And I installed everything,
and ran the command I needed for another project.

And everything is beautiful,
and simple now.

I simply said, ```yokel install ../h[TAB]```
which printed ```yokel install ../heebiejeebies```

Due to Linux directory completion,
I pressed enter.

---

This new AI is just a few days old,
and all I saw was negative critique – that is just crazy to me.

As far I care to see why people are like this,
they are probably using tools that shouldn't exist.

And hold their expectations,
in the wrong place or context.

This thing is so powerful, especially for students,
that anything less than this, is a waste of time.

I believe, that if you sit down to memorizing,
of another High School quiz – you will destroy your life.

Go to the library, get on the computer,
ignore the yokels, find the latest best AI.

And say, teach me JavaScript,
create a text only cheat sheet, syntax memorization sheet.

And write me some poems,
promising that programming will take my doubt away.

---

Do not ruin your life,
use AI as a real teacher, and then as your programming team.

Start off classy, aim for development of desktop applications,
use open source electron fiddle, to get an instant start.

And get on with it, I mean look around, loot at your teacher,
look at the expectations your parents have of school.

You are already over a year late, to realize,
everything is new, and AI is here to help you.

Learn,
for real this time.
