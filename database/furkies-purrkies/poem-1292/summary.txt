How Parasites Ate School; And On Hiking, Camping And Listening To Great Books
Thursday • September 14th 2023 • 10:12:29 pm

At any point in life, hiking and Camping, and later waking the great trails,
Appalachian, Pacific Crest, or Continental Divide…

Will pull you out of stress, overwork; or bullies and punishment even,
any of which will actually prevent meaningful education from taking place.

---

The stress of failing in school, the carrot and stick of GPA, and bullies,
be they teachers or fractured students, also put an end to learning.

The ineffective schools of today,
will only sell you an impression of education.

And it will take a long time for you to catch on,
sometimes it takes decades to see how schools were just forcing you to pretend.

---

Stress is a large part of the overall reason why schools are not working,
organized education was actually a perfect brew, that called out to liars.

Any and all of humanity’s great achievements, must be designed ground up,
to resist corruption, that was not the case with schools.

----

The students were practically begging to graduate,
out of discomfort ineffective education caused.

---

Making lectures irrelevant to student’s personal curiosities,
dividing knowledge into disconnected subjects…

Combines with the sick idea of timed learning persiods.
Among several other massively toxic mistakes…

Will make students,
desperate and scared.

It will force them to prefer to memorize and graduate,
rather than comprehend and educate for real.

---

The state tests that validate schools,
and keep the sweet state funding coming...

See no difference between memorized knowledge,
and actual comprehension, active and functional knowledge, and wisdom.

All that teachers have to do to trick you into memorization,
is make their curricula incomprehensible and threaten you with failure.

All the while saying, please do not just memorize,
they develop a compulsion to throw that into the fray.

And chuck in “my job is hard“ for good measure,
but you can see exactly what their job is - pretending to educate.

---

It will be hard for you to see the overall fraud,
because you believe in adults, that they work hard.

They don’t, they take every shortcut they can get away with,
you can see that in politics or investing, where that is usually bough to light.

It is not illegal for politician to lie abo...

...their math skills…

I am sorry, we are vulnerable to indoctrination,
and this has been exploited fo thousands of years.

---

Which is why, you need to get your parents, and walk the trails,
with narrated books in your ears.

Books created by clear thinking intellectuals who achieved,
not because they were lucky…

But because they wouldn't let anything stain them,
let them teach you about restraint, dignity, nobility, unbreakability…

Fortitude, courage, honor, love; and insight; and foresight; and understanding;
and authenticity; and heroism; and so much more.

All the while walking the great trails with your family,
already creating a legacy, a place, where you will forever feel at home at.

---

When your parents find out how long the trails are,
tell them, it is part of having babies, it never gets easier.

Especially now, that you know how urgent your real education is,
and that they are slowly realizing… that it was probably a bad idea...

To just think of school as convenient babysitter,
that will at the very least teach you how to socialize…

And if they’re lucky get you shipped out of the basement,
straight to college, debt, and your won damn problems.

Now go, take your parents shopping, you will need nifty backpacks,
three season tents, and sleeping backs, and gnarly Bowie knives.

You will need tick spray, bug spray, hair spray, bear spray,
and pepper spray, just in case dad wants to stay on the couch.

Where you are headed three is nether overwork, nor couch nor TV,
and in the quest of wisdom, you won’t just discover knowledge.

But youth, health, endurance, joy,
a life so long and so filled with unforgettable memories.

That your will have no trouble discovering that to learn,
means to grow up… to grow all the way up, until become a great being.

Whose positive and lasting contributions,
will pave a trail of adventure, that will help countless others rise just the same.
