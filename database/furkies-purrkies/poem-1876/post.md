While your body simply prefers to grow at its own speed,
needing to start with the lightest of dumbbells for extended periods.

Then slowly adapting to lift heavier and heavier,
for one hour, two and maybe three.

There are many changes going on,
and sometimes they will add up, and cause trouble.

---

Your workout is already,
built atop a shaky foundation.

Weather, is one large change, temperature at your gym,
will make you sweat more, and lose more salt.

Your very own genetics, according to many,
and no doubt diet, play into that.

And you end up losing more salt,
without any visible changes in your life.

That will result in muscle spasms,
muscle tightness, back pain.

---

Add abrupt dietary changes,
an extra long or tough workout.

And that,
will eventually result in trouble.

---

It can be back pain,
or some other injury.

But it is more likely to reduced results,
if any.

For example, if you lift too heavy,
you can’t lift for long enough to adapt.

And that means you won’t ever lift heavier,
and thus won’t grow muscle.

Beyond your initial,
couch to gym upgrade.

---

Understand that you start in the beginning,
and the results come slowly but surely.

But you too must pace yourself with changes that you control,

From not switching to faster music too abruptly,
to never swapping one diet to another.

Go slow, and flow, at the speed,
that your muscles grow.
