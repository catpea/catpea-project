I’ve been talking about writing a book,
probably since before High School.

But my idea of books,
has somewhat grown up.

First of all, you can’t just write a book,
in a way this is the worst thing you can do.

You have to record the audio,
the written word is just backup.

You don’t ever finish a book,
you just can’t go on, out of kindness to your listeners.

Once you get near the 300 hour mark,
you need to, just chill.

A 300 hour audio book,
is in a way, basically, 30 books.

My book at present is 100 hours,
and I am still doing introduction.

I started with very simple poems,
that almost seem unusual.

And now, I got to software development,
and am just beginning emphasis on self education.

300 hours,
only sounds funny.

But it is actually a beginning,
a middle, and a something else.

In High School I was pondering,
an integrated lecture.

But from my own audio-book listening experience,
that things need to repeat.

Ten minute poems as I call them,
work for me.

I really enjoy that a poem,
has a beginning and an end.

Meaning, your next addition,
starts in the beginning.

It is OK to repeat your thoughts,
it thickens your delivery.

Your audience will arrive,
from many different cultures and contexts.

Some poems won’t work at all,
others will be just the right configuration.

But at ten minutes in length,
you are __sure __ to share a touch of your wisdom.

I underestimated books,
back in High School.

They are not,
sheets of information.

They are, software,
they are programs for the mind.

They are upgrades,
for our perfectly unique, operating systems.

They come to life,
they shape themselves to fit us.

And they will take on different shape,
based on our level of wisdom.

---

And the best of them,
are funny.

All 300 hours,
of funny and inspiration, no chill.

And don’t sell your audio books,
give them away.

Don’t put obstacles,
in the way of sharing your thoughts.

You can sell the paper,
and sdƐๅๅ-ɔɥǝɔʞǝp version.

Know that,
well narrated books especially…

Are the only way,
to move humanity towards the future.

Different people,
will need a different combination of books.

They’ll take away different parts,
if they re-read them…

They will learn,
new knowledge.

But never,
in the sequence you set.

They will learn,
in patches, let them shuffle.

Finally, don’t stop,
finish your first book.

And then start,
on your second one.

And if you need a title,
call it Part Two.
