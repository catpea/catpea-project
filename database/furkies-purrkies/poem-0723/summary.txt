A Programmer's Poem: ORM, REST, OPSEC, MOO, And A Scary Smelly Grue
Monday • February 21st 2022 • 4:00:23 pm

You know how down at the CPU level,\
you have talk in ones and zeros, XOR and AND.

We created a nicer languages above that,\
like C, where you can nest functions.

You can have an UPSERT function,\
that contains INSERT or UPDATE functions.

If data in whatever the program is using is missing,\
then we INSERT, and if it already there then we UPDATE.

So UPSERT encompasses multiple functions,\
and it is pretty readable.

Now, on C level,\
we have to define things.

You can't just say, name = alice,\
you have to define a name array, and remember a string terminator.

To store the five letter name Alice,\
you need an array of six characters, for the name and a string terminator character.

It is a good language,\
but we invented better.

We have languages where we can just say name = alice,\
and everything will be taken care of for us.

Even better than that,\
we have languages where you can say name = evaluate name - alice; return name

This is called an eval statement,\
and everyone is scared of it, becasue you are running code inside code.

Though you never use it in production,\
eval is a sign of a healthy language.

If a language prevents you from evaluating code,\
then it is a language for cubicle workers, crafted to control the coders.

JavaScript is a very free language,\
it will let you add a number to a letter.

And will probably return the sum of the number and ASCII code of the letter,\
but it may also try to concatenate, or who cares.

This language does not try to control you,\
it will let you do whatever the heck you want.

Even if it is crazy,\
like adding letters to numbers, which is also crazy awesome.

And a sign,\
that corporate has not meddled with the language standard.

Once some big corporation steps in,\
they will strip the language of easy mistakes.

Load it up on computers,\
give it to all the High Schools.

Wait for them to graduate college,\
and then charge them for the enterprise version.

Or for business use,\
or for business license.

Or cancel the language,\
because they have something that will generate more profits.

---

You have to stick with the rebel languages,\
that is what everyone else will be going.

Unless they got trapped in a cubicle,\
then they will spout how evil eval is.

You see, REST is good, but WikiWiki teaches us,\
the power of consistency.

What if we just had Locations,\
like WikiPedia has articles.

If you are allowed to cross the pathway,\
into a location, because you have a password key, then you can update your password.

If you don't have this feature in your inventory,\
then you can't access that location.

TO be clear I am describing a tiny mechanism that builds on top of ORM,\
and though it has paths, those are not RESTFUL paths, they are of the Dungeon World.

They are an anthropomorphized world of objects,\
and it is tiny and efficient, nothing at all like some bloated VR world.

Rails, [strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi), or Cake even is all the proof that Objects and Properties can be defined with a normal User Interface,\
ORM objects can be built by non-programmers.

If MUD can replace the paths of REST and make them more secure,\
then then company you invent can allow for Web Application programming, to people who hate code.

Not because they can't program, or don't want to learn,\
but because they can sense that it is the old way - that better abstractions can be had.

Like programming web applications,\
through a kind of a game.

Oh, sure is sounds goofy,\
you are walking around dungeons after all.

But if Mallory touches that password door,

without the correct key in his inventory, he gets eaten by a [Grue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ZVzl_H_2w).

Maybe we need to consider, that pretending abstractions are not leaky is goofy,\
and that using an intelligent system that resembles the mechanics of a real world isn't goofy.

You are looking at highly sophisticated security systems,\
that are as easy to comprehend for a human as using a key to inlock a door, or check out an article from the user's home library.

It may even be the key of strong AI,\
that can improve it self - because why stop here?

Anyways, when you have a Grue on your blue team,\
that consistently chomps red team members, the world becomes a much happier place.

For those of you struggling to come up with a name for this new and groundgreaking technology, I offer:\
Complete And Thorough Protective Electronic Armor, or C.A.T.P.E.A. for short.
