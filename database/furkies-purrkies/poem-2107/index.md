Your body is a finely tuned machine,
my doctor always says “coffee is good for you”, but it is not.

There are only two sources of energy food,
and fresh songs that make you want to dance.

Coffee will make you cross boundaries your body prefers you don’t cross,
it is not nutrition, it is forcing your body to do something it does not want to do.

Not only will you be energized at wrong times of day relative to your schedule,
you will also be tired at wrong times of day.

---

You get no shortcuts, you can’t cheat your body into a workout,
just like you can’t just start painting masterpieces.

Respect your sleep schedule,
let it stabile by waking up at the same time.

And then honor it,
you may still need a jolt of energy, but you must honor the schedule your body sets.

That puts you into the real energy zone,
you are resting correctly, doing what your body expects you to do.

You can’t cheat a great ape that evolved for 4 billion years,
with a bean, you need sleep, rest, health.

---

Once you stop sabotaging your body with coffee,
and a stupid sleep schedule.

You need to remember that you have superpowers,
you are an adaptive biomechanical machine.

That means, you can slowly, at the speed that your body allows,
raise your endurance, precisely, like joggers do it.

Start slow, eliminate rest, celebrate, go faster,
adapt some more.

---

For bodybuilding, you don’t focus on speed of jogging,
you focus on weighing your self down.

You do that by carrying dumbbells in your hands,
you will trip and fall, make sure the dumbbell plates protect your fingers.

You can continue increasing your dumbell weight,
if you only go up by 2.5 pounds.

The 5 pound gap that we see at the gym is too wide,
you can’t go up by a total of 10 pounds, 5 pounds is the maximum.

Please be responsible and respectful to your body,
and use wrist weights making the gap even smaller.

Go from five pounds per hand,
to six or six and a half, and then sever and a half.

---

You can clearly see,
how that will keep you going.

---

Once it becomes too cold, or your dumbbells become too heavy and dangerous,
you sign up for the gym.

You begin working out with young lads who perfume themselves to smell nice,
use the same toilets that seem to be used by unclean local fat ass hobos too.

And you will discover, that not a single elderly who is always cold,
puts on a shirt, they they instead demand that the entire area is heated.

What feels warm for the elderly, is scorching heat for the endurance bodybuilder,
so water is next, urine must be light green.

You weigh yourself before a workout,  and right after,
to figure out how much electrolyte water you lost, and act accordingly.

Life is dangerous, couch is dangerous,
workouts are dangerous.

---

Don’t go too fast, study yourself,
earn body wisdom, or you will hurt yourself.

Two years ago one gentleman was spending too much time working on his back,
it just didn’t seem right.

I told him to stop, it maybe easy, but it just does not seem right,
I told him to light light and long.

And he did hurt his back, and needed a procedure, a small surgery,
I suspect he does not come to the gym as often now.

He learned his wisdom the hard way,
doing it wrong is not worth it.

---

To support endurance bodybuilding,
which is converting your jogging into a light but dynamic dance.

You will need hiker food,
nuts, dried fruit, seeds.

You can blend it into a protein shake,
or soak it in hot water, so that you don’t endanger your teeth or dental work.

The rest of your meals, are as perfected as the hiker food,
this time by farmers, meals that inspire military food as well.

Few candies, a bit of coffee, meat, bean, vegetables,
farmer food.

Farmers, had to work hard to survive,
they have finely tuned their diets for long lasting energy.

I recently learned that the lady at the front desk in my Doctor’s office,
eats a single vitamin, same one I discovered too by going over labels of energy drinks.

She said she takes B vitamin in the morning,
we aren’t sure if it is placebo effect ort not,.

But, multivitamins will contain Zinc and Magnesium,
and if you find a pill bottle with that, it will warn you to take it before sleep.

Those of you who have been taking vitamins in the morning,
have been putting yourselves to sleep at noon.

Another reason why coffee is trouble,
people will try to drink coffee not understanding…

That electrolytes are helping them recover,
by sending them to bed.

B vitamin in the morning,
multivitamins in the late afternoon.

---

At the gym, you will need to synchronize your motion to music,
one beat up, next beat down.

Cycle your standing dumbbell exercises,
so that you never need to stop, as different muscle groups rest.

And you will not only need fresh music,
that actually makes you dance, makes you want to do fluid motions.

But you need to move away from distractions,
because you will not be able to keep going if you can’t enter a dance trance.

It is the same kind of thing you enter into,
when you let your body control the car on your way back from work.

Notice, how there is nothing distracting you,
when you enter your trance.

Though there are lots of cars on the road,
they are all average, doing average things.

---

At the gym, a dancer will not upset your focus,
it will encourage you and validate that you are in the right palce.

You will also help other people feel comfortable,
with more dynamic workouts.

A good workout, ultimately,
is the difference between life and death.

It is the people who are showing off, or aren’t working out,
that may upset your focus, in which case, you move to anther corner of the gym.

---

My last piece of gym advice, is for those of you who want instant results,
without removing kitchen appliances, going hiking and camping, or bicycling.

Find a class of stop watch called an in interval timer, you can find apps,
off brand clones, unfortunately there aren’t too many companies that produce them..

Set your interval timer to one minute workout, one minute rest,
clip it on your waist band.

And let the vibrate function tell you when to go and stop,
as your body adapts expand the workout duration, and adjust your rest period.

With the eventual aim, of eliminating your rest entirely,
and working out non stop.

I think accomplishment the same through jogging maybe more pleasant,
as you never have to jog very fast with dumbbells I hands.

But jogging wants good stable weather, well behaved passers by,
preferably crisp and green mornings willed with park trees away from cars.

An interval timer, forces you to do things at the gym,
where like a terrible fat bird, all you get, is a mirror.

---

Lastly, the rule is simple, it is not about how heavy you lift,
it is about how long you lift your heavy for,

You have to start light, not so light that you can lift more,
but never so heavy, that you are forced to stop.

As you body adapts, it gives you a little extra,
so you add a little bit more weight.

---

Get mad, y have been cheated out of bodybuilding by bad advice,
and I think it is time for you to get angry at ineffective education.

Because an ineffective workout, where you call cutting off your circulation,
some kind of mystical muscle failure that will make you buff, is a betrayal.

You need to put an end to the myth of sets and reps,
because it only makes you old and frail.
