Memorizing Is Not Learning
Monday • October 5th 2020 • 9:21:31 pm

To learn something you must hunger for it,

to learn something, you must love it.

To learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,

and learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.

---

Every little bit counts,

but only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.

If you attempt to learn things out of sequence,

or worse yet, trust someone to teach you,

it won't work, it never has, it never will, forget it.

And it is not just sequence,

it is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.

---

Sequence and Pace,

now that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.

You, can do better than that,

you certainly should.

When you learn is important,

night owls will learn at a different time of day than others.

It is the environment that matters,

some people can't learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.

And, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,

visit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neustädter Kirche in Hanover Germany,

visit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.

And remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,

but by tracing their development across the ages.

---

Schools are here to teach us,

but they don't know how.

What they do know,

is how to fake it,

and make it appear like you are learning.

The motive is simple,

for as long as the school gets funding,

everyone gets to keep their job.

Yes,

it is fraud.

Yes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,

the curriculum is impossible to learn from.

Curriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,

so that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,

and they will expect you to cram before that test too.

---

If you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,

you need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,

a public school is not the optimal setting for education.

---

A public school is primary for babysitting,

so that you're not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.

In order for that school to exist,

teacher...

...ly,

I am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.

There is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,

that is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.

---

Even now, I can't see everything that has gone wrong,

schools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.

But even so, the fact remains,

today schools can't teach.

They are wicked good,

at tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.

At the end of the day,

[you will still need an education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGoZZvfEd6A).

Your only safe bet,

is becoming self taught,

independent study.

And please, don't let anybody call you a Genius,

help others, help them find knowledge too.

Finally,

I describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,

on a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.

But, I do know one thing for certain,

this is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.

This is a call for heroism,

for courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.

This is how Life asks for help,

you are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.

Become a Great Being,

Fix Schools.
