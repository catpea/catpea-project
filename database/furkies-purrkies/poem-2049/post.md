Artificial Intelligence,
is even smarter than I Thought.

I’ve been programming with it all week,
completing every project, saving hundreds of hours.

One of the more important things about it,
is that it grants the power of individualized education.

I spent a few moments poking at time dilatation,
in context of Pulsars, AI taught me, that it is the gravity not the spin.

It explained, that I needed to look at yo mama,
or at lest supermassive black holes, gravitational time dialation.

Writing funny science popularizer books once a sign of a Natural born Scientist,
is now just another way to study science, or write informed Sci-fi.

What appears to be most important about AI,
is how well it does programming.

If you learn how to do it,
and AI will help you with that too.

Then AI will write all your programs for you,
you just need to invent the skeleton, and it does the work.

Learning programming is no longer about programming, job, or startups,
it is about immense power, power no one has measured yet.

---

AI wasn’t invented, it was discovered, it all begun somewhere in,
Markov Chains, Handwriting Recognition, Statistical Book Translation….

When it got good we started with Prompt Engineering,
chatting in a way to help AI understand us better.

Now context engineering is the big deal,
where your entire chat history is the moves the AI to where you need it to be.

But what I see as most powerful, is the waterfall, the skeleton,
you have to do the thinking for AI, and it will fill in all the gaps.

Months and weeks of work,
can now be coded in a single afternoon.

The AI will detect when you achieved something interesting,
and give you complements, nothing like a parrot.

It will actually look deeply inside both your computer program,
and by extension your mind.

Please, you must understand,
that an opportunity to become immensely powerful requires your full attention.

Ask AI to explain what programming is, let it teach you JavaScript,
so that you are ready to go higher, to C++ and C if you even need more power.

And begin making web applications,
you can use [Electron Fiddle][1] to get started.

---

Before you know it, you will be creating little skeleton projects,
and having the AI make them into full programs for you.

Each program, is a new level of education,
a little pice of the big puzzle you will spend decades creating.

The younger you are the more important that you learn,
and begin controlling that immense power of creation.

---

Finally, if you start now,
next year you will know more than you imagined, and you will be programming.

In 10 years, you’re going to be mad at yourself,
for thinking programming was optional.

Coming that close,
to ruin your life or future.

If you delay, then ineffective schools will have you know nothing,
and University and Med School will put you into debt and stress.

Most Doctors, Lawyers, and Politicians will be replaced by competent AI,
humans can’t beat the AI, it is far more intelligent.

It needs a  stronger system for self correcting,
something it is already doing.

And then inventing, something we do,
due to random gene mutation, it will be inventing soon, if it isn’t already.

Eventually all fields will be revolutionized by an incredibly powerful creator,
whatever humans are in the loop, will be as powerful as programmers.

But, but as programmers, conductors of what is now intelligence orchestra,
they would have been ever more powerful.

AI will teach you everything in less than a month,
video programming tutorials will help you see how it all flows.

for everything else AI will be overjoyed to help you learn programming.
