When A Wild Goose In On The Loose, Protect Your Caboose
Saturday • March 18th 2023 • 10:57:32 pm

Please don’t get me wrong, I love geese,
and wish for nothing less than hugs and peace.

But I yelled and honked at one thrice today,
because there was a lot of traffic speeding our way.

I said “Goose! have you no brains?”,
“this street has like six busy lanes”.

It baffles me that they dangerously walk the ground,
when they can just fly around.

And I kept proper and respectful distance,
and was even ready to get out and give assistance.

As far at the scientists know,
geese are just angry Brontosaurus that don’t grow.

And though we are always told,
that Vikings were first to this part of the world...

Legends say they didn’t settle it __because__ of a goose,
it was said she was mightier than a rabid moose.

And was often seen after dark,
dining on a freshly cooked shark.

So, she scared all the fierce vikings away,
and some say, she haunts the east coast to this day.

Alas, she allowed pilgrims to stay,
because she got them to feed her candy corn all day.

And though in Michigan it gets really cold,
or, so I am told.

The local geese don’t fly away at all,
they just hang out behind the local mall.

They are tough birds that we should all admire,
but golly, you definitely don’t want face one in a quagmire.

The particular specimen I came across today,
stopped __all the traffic__ and got her way.

After I yelled, she turned around and didn’t care,
she instead lifted her fat feathery fluffy butt in the air.

And looking me square in the eye took an angry toxic dump,
giving me a hot-flash, and making me jump.
