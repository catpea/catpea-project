We talk about fake news, and manufactures consent,
but entirely fail to see forced indoctrination and fake education.

That is what ineffective education is, fake,
sucker born every minute; fake.

Humanity must progress forward,
fake education will only take us back to the dark ages.

Programming has the ability to serve as a model of authentic education,
because students will want to learn other subjects the way they learned programming.

Programming is special, because it won’t produce results,
aren’t taught correctly, this is the reason why some teachers use paper.

---

Here you can also catch a glimpse, of how it models Authentic Teaching as well,
if all you do is scribble on paper, it is just as meaningless as programming on a whiteboard.

---

There is a lot of finger pointing here,
from teachers who just want to put food on the table.

To brand names,
standing as proof, that people do expect that a sucker is born every minute.

But, even if there was time, attempting to convince someone,
that they received fake education, is a fools errand.

Let’s just get to fixing everything instead,
we have art and text AI, however faint that intelligence it is a lot of help.

And we start where we all started,
computer games.

Except here, the trail of achievements, educates,
in a way that is fun and provides real world results.

The first few steps is really easy,
to quote a child of a famous programmer: “coding is basically just ifs and for loops.”

But right pas the training levels,
the player will see something that hasn’t been done before.

A screen-full of levels that create real programmer thing,
much more than a promise of working for some non-profit.

Things that sell, browser extensions, popular CMS themes,
phone apps, things that represent winning the level in a major way.

This is my challenge to you,
write the educational games so well…

That the students will stay home but not playing,
but doing it for real.

Young people don’t’ need years of experience,
they need Object Modeling, Flow Programming, Visual Programming.

They don’t need to learn to see it all,
they just need better tools than we had.

Schools have failed them, no student comes home,
cheerfully pronouncing programming to be “just ifs and for loops”.

Lets fix this, and give the young students optics necessary,
to identify ineffective education.
