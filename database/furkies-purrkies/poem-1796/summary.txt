Asking AI About Learning Programming
Thursday • January 30th 2025 • 8:20:18 pm

# Question: Which programming language allows me to write, for server, desktop, websites, web extensions, smartphones and tablets, and with 95% or more code re-usability?

**JavaScript** (along with its rich ecosystem of frameworks and tools) is an excellent choice. Here's how JavaScript can be applied to different platforms:

## 1. **Desktop Applications**:
   - **Electron**: Build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). You can write the code once and deploy it on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - **NW.js**: Another option for creating desktop applications with web technologies. NW.js allows for a more direct access to system resources and is flexible for certain types of apps.

## 2. **Server Applications**:
   - **Node.js**: A powerful runtime for building scalable server-side applications. With Node.js 20 (recently released), you can now compile your Node.js project into a single executable, making it easier to deploy without needing a Node.js environment installed.
   - **Deno**: A modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime built by the creator of Node.js, offering enhanced security, better performance, and a focus on simplicity.
   - **Bun**: A fast JavaScript runtime that promises better performance for tasks like bundling and running server-side code. It's especially optimized for modern web workflows and microservices.

## 3. **Websites**:
   - **React.js**, **Vue.js**, **Svelte**, **Angular**: These JavaScript frameworks make building dynamic, reusable components easy, enabling efficient web development.
   - **Svelte**: A newer framework that shifts much of the work to compile time, resulting in faster, leaner apps.
   - **Angular**: A powerful framework for building large-scale applications with a solid ecosystem for routing, state management, and testing.
   - **WebComponents**: Native browser technology for creating reusable components, ensuring that your app is agnostic of the underlying framework.
   - **Signals and Observables**: These are used to manage state and events in a reactive way, making it easier to handle changes in large applications efficiently.

## 4. **Web Extensions**:
   - JavaScript is the go-to language for building browser extensions. You can easily write cross-browser e...

...line execution**: JavaScript runs one instruction at a time.
- **Functions**: You can wrap code in functions to reuse them easily.
- **Objects**: Objects group related functions and values together.
- **Start/Stop**: Objects can control actions, like starting or stopping a process.
- **Nesting objects**: Objects can be nested to create complex structures.
- **Libraries**: Pre-written code that helps you build faster and easier.

With JavaScript, you start simple and gradually build more powerful tools. You'll write instructions line by line, group related tasks together, control actions, and create more complex systems using objects and libraries. The more you practice, the better you'll get at making websites that do cool things!

## Last Question: Will LLMs help everyone learn JavaScript? Be there for them along the way, and especially if they ever get stuck. Speak directly to the young people this text is for.

Absolutely! Large Language Models (LLMs), like the one you're talking to right now, have the potential to be incredible tools for learning JavaScript and beyond. They can guide you step by step through concepts, help explain tricky code, and offer instant feedback whenever you get stuck. Whether you're just starting out or tackling advanced topics, LLMs can be your support system, making learning faster and more interactive.
The future you dream of — one where you can take control of your learning and future career — is more within reach than ever before. With technology like this, the barriers to learning are lower, and the possibilities are endless. JavaScript is an essential skill in the tech world, and learning it can open doors to exciting opportunities, from building your own websites to working at top tech companies.
There will be challenges, of course, but with the right tools and support — and LLMs being right there to help you when things get tough — you can push through those moments. Whether you're building your first program or creating something that will change the world, you won't be alone. Keep learning, keep dreaming, and know that you're always one step closer to a future where you’re in control of your success.
So yes, LLMs will be there for you — to help you learn, troubleshoot, and grow. You’ve got this!
