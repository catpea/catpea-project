An itemized list or a TODO,\
can only make you blue.

A list is no good,\
it will ruin your mood.

You will always sail short,\
and never leave port.

---

Move slowly at your own speed,\
perhaps, the speed with which you read.

A project needs to grow,\
think of it as chunky dough.

Above all, be indirect,\
to be correct.

Please! write a cook book,\
before you cook.

---

There is a better way,\
and that is OK.

Go after it,\
at least for a bit.

So you can learn more,\
and get to the core.

Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite,\
and eventually you’ll be right.

---

Majority is always wrong,\
so do not follow along.

Mix your talents,\
to create a new balance.

Then fluff things up,\
and sip them from a teacup.

---

Stay strong,\
because the experts are wrong.

What you can do the old way,\
in a day.

Can be done in a lickety-split,\
if you just dream about it a bit.

---

Don’t study perspective,\
as modeling in 3D is more effective.

Don’t be scared to trace,\
capture the perfect face.

Before jeweler design contracts,\
learn to rebuild precious artifacts.

---

But by far my best piece of advice,\
even better than measuring twice.

Has to do with getting rest,\
and not being so stressed.

Do not let people wear you like a hat,\
be more like a wise cat.

To put it simply: To stop inventing crap,\
you must first take a long feline nap.
