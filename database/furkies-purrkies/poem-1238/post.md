They are well rooted in reality,
and each has an awesome political personality.

Kittens especially find politics to be a big deal,
and each cat will improve policy with great zeal.

With class and great ease,
they would quickly bring about world peace.

At first most things would stay the same,
but neat little changes would always be the aim.

---

And once inspired or inclined,
cats will of course think beyond the human kind.

They will demand a balance with nature,
and __that__ is a sign of a wise legislature.

---

Because cats see pretending to learn as rather strange.
schools will have to change.

That will be the one big thing,
that’s what the cats will really bring.

They will want us to learn for real,
they know, education is a really big deal.

They will eliminate all the tests,
and have the students learn from interesting little quests.

Everyone will have to listen to narrated books,
as cats know that’s the only way to beat the real crooks.

---

And as you might have guessed,
cats will encourage us to relax and take plenty of rest.

Naps are going to become extremely important for all,
and here humanity will finally have a ball.

A world united in serenity and wisdom,
is a pretty gosh darn good system.

But I think cats will still try to inspire us to even more,
they will expect us to rise towards greatness, and then, soar.

---

If you help you kitty with a campaign,
they will run for the office without complain.

Somehow, cats just naturally know,
how to do politics, and which way to go.

They just have a nose for finding the right way,
which is a lot more than any of our politicians today.
