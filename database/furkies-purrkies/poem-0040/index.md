Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Five.

I am not sure that the end of quarantine will ever arrive,

so I am preparing to write enough poetry to fill a hard drive.

I think I shall begin writing about cats,

and then complain a bit about bureaucrats.

When I am done complaining,

I shall pick something more entertaining.

Like perhaps musing about Lowbrow Art,

and then carry on babbling about someone smart.

Maybe a Scientist, or a Philosopher like Descartes,

or maybe a colorful leader like Napoleon Bonaparte.

Then, when, I'll run out of things to babble on,

I will jump on my bicycle and set off at dawn,

I'll bring my notepad and a pen,

and come up with a new idea,

every now and then.
