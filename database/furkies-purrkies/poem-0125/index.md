Great Adventures need not take you far,

and ultimately, wherever you go there you are.

But still, there **is** something special about new places,

we see more deeply, and get in good graces.

I think the kind of adventure, that **really** is the best,

will make you start keeping a little journal to document your quest.

When there is time to think about all the things and little bits,

even the slightest curiosity will bring about new wits.

So fill all the journal pages, and leave it for later,

because you never know when a little journal may become something greater.

It could come as a surprise that this little adventure you took,

turned you into a Famous Writer and became your first Adventure Book!
