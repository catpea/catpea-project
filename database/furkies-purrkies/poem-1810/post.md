1980’s Aerobics with dumbbells, must come first
alternatively you can jog with dumbbells.

But you must first establish an hour long, non-stop,
standing dumbbell exercise to build on.

Lifting duration,
is much more important than how much weight you begin with.

Extending your workout duration,
makes a much more profound impression on your body.

It will begin adapting very quickly,
especially since you are giving it time by lifting light.

If you just lift heavy,
you won’t be able to lift for long enough.

You may just end up cutting of your circulation,
and that does not do anything.

This is where boys fail, they start off too heavy,
and only lift for seconds.

Lifting for seconds, is not enough to ask you body to adapt,
beyond that initial growth where they go from couch to weightlifting.

Too heavy means,
that they can’t lift heavier and for longer.

They are maxed out in weight, and not lifting for long enough,
so they have nowhere to go, to push their body again.

What they need to do to recover from their cursed plateau,
is find the light weight equivalent, that they can lift for an hour.

This will restart their exercise routine,
and set them on the correct course.

But the rule remains,
duration is more important then the weight.

Eventually, they will move on to 10lb and 15lb for an hour,
which is slow, and heavy, and profound; and no longer aerobics.

Standing dumbbells give you a full body workout, and you don’t stop,
because you can switch to a different muscle group.

For example, lifting above your head for a while,
restores your biceps, then you can go back, and later switch again.

---

The rule is, lift light but not so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy that you are forced to stop for more than a few seconds.

Consider [shuffle dancing with][6] dumbells,
as it helps you with flexibility and really accelerates your transformation.

A maintenance workout is daily,
for 45 minutes or a hour.

But that is for after you have reached your fitness goals,
during your quest you only get two days off.

But just like with jogging take it slow, and build up fairly,
it must not crush you or overwhelm you.

It is best to run, outdoors,
where ground is soft, air is fresh, and teh scenery is always chaniging.

Start off every other day and when starting your jogging or Aerobics,
either use an [Interval Timer][0] or [Couch25K][1].

To configure your interval timer you just measure how long you can lift for,
and how much you need to rest, to do it again, several times over.

The whole point of an interval timer is to slowly,
eliminate all your rest gaps.

You may wish to consider getting some [zero-drop wide toe-box shoes][4],
pay attention to the softness abound your ankle and back of foot.

If it is not foam, padding, or looks like a sweater sleeve,
and instead looks more like a rope or trim, that may hurt you.

Protect your feet so that they don’t get scratched up,
but if you are just beginning you may get blisters anyway.

That only happens once, as your feet prepare for activity,
thicker socks may help, but also you must keep your feet dry.

Zero drop is to protect you from pump bump,
and the wide tobox protects your toenails and is just healthey.

I drink vegetable juice, eat bananas,
and use trail mix for energy, coffee if I work late.

But you best source of [nutrition and hydration wisdom][5],
are Marathon and Ultra-marathon runners.

---

Finally, you can’t work out with out music,
I recommend you get [Over The Ear Headphones with a Card Slot][2]

And find some slow songs, or just start with [Eurodance][3],
as when you have light weights things are not that hard.

The point is to find fresh music you haven’t heard in a while,
but you will drain those songs of energy, so you will need more.

You must never just listen to songs while working out,
you have to move with the beat

That is how you enter a dance trance,
and stay focused making your workout feel like a minute or two.

---

And remember, fitness is not for the looks,
it is a life extension technique.

It the same priority as eating food,
work can wait, your health and long life, comes first.
