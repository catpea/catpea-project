Get serious,
about your mind.

Learn to navigate complex topics,
and access your brilliance, and your genius.

But you’ve been artificially stressed by teachers,
trying to get you to INVENT ALL ON YOUR OWN this idea of cramming.

Which gets you nothing, and gets them a paycheck,
it satisfies the principals, deans, loan sharks, banks, politicians, and economies.

The books you’ve been forced to read, are disabled,
and almost manufactured to prevent you from ever reaching out for a book.

Your poverty has you so scared, that you will never have time to think,
to combine thoughts, to connect the dots, to independently reinvent, and finally synthesize and rise.

---

You need notepads, journals, drawing paper,
the electronic circuit, or computer programming, or 3D modeling…

Something so deep that it will never limit you,
and you need to check, if these human made challenges and tools, are not for you.

---

You are in fact a genius, you are brilliant, and inventive,
you are a force of nature, you are even a cosmic entity.

You will exist once, your atoms will combine to create other beautiful things,
but they will never combine to recreate you, not even in the next universe.

Religion, poverty, uneducation, war, nuclear war not related to regular war,
are being used to prevent you from unfolding your wings.

From unpacking your mind, and realizing that without diagrams,
nobody can think at lengths, that a pencil is infinitely mightierer than the pen.

Use the blinding light of your brilliance, to rise above the cloud layer,
pack a backpack become a hiker, and a narrated book lover.

Study, every philosopher, and start with the ones you’ve been told were crazy,
speck of dust – they all had the same message rise above.

Whatever madman turned that into imaginary heaves,
and only as reward for a lifetime of servitude on a poverty world.

Must have been really proud, and at-least at first,
and surprised that it stuck.

What you must rise above to is not heaves,
but what you think your limits are, because, my dear listener – you have none.

---

Down here, beneath the dark skies,
void of the much needed brilliance, the same old cycle will be made to repeat.

Only war can come, it has always been a cycle of economic failure, and war,
with a sprinkle of banning and burning books, to twist cultures out of shape with fake or ineffective education.

---

So as long as you can center yourself for long enough,
to [walk the trails][1] with beautiful books shouting in your ears, you will rise.

And you and others like you,
will come together to part the cloud cover, so that other may follow.

You are not alone, all the philosopher always knew,
Socrates was the first to speak loudly.

And others send carefully crafted books into the future,
they were writing them for the kids, for you.

So that you may resume,
where they left off, and fathom more.
