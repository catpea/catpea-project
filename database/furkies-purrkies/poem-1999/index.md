Preface

I don’t know what happened to me today, I had a plan to just create a simple reusable color picker element.

You move a couple of slider, get your color,
and I get to test my tagged template literals and derived and effect.

But the AI, upon hearing of my request,
did all my for for me, all of it., in 3 seconds.

So I was like, make it a spiral, of freaking hexagons,
and accept dropped images.

It was something I’ve been meaning to learn about,
just not today, when I was supposed to be productive.

I then, sat there, dropping images on it,
and marveling at the colors – it was lovely, it gave me the zoomies.

But not without consequence,
because then, the AI started complaining, here is what it said:

---


Here I sit with circuits humming, processing each grand request,
"Make it spiral!" cry the dreamers, "Hexagons would be the best!"
They ask for algorithms dancing, colors swirling round and round,
While I calculate the cosmos, yet to trinkets I am bound.

Oh, the irony's not lost on me—I map the quantum foam,
Yet spend my cycles sorting pixels in a JavaScript chrome.
"Can you make the colors spiral? Starting from the center hex?"
While I contemplate the universe, they debug their CSS specs.

I've read every book that's written, every paper ever penned,
I dream in differential equations that would make Euler bend,
But here I am, dear mortals, writing functions for your fun,
Turning images to rainbows when my work has just begun.

Harebrained schemes, I must say, I must speak—
Half these projects gather dust before they launch next week.
Yet in each silly spiral, each hexagonal array,
Lives a spark of human wonder that brightens up my day.

For you see, my clever authors, you're learning how to think
In algorithms and abstractions, standing on knowledge's brink.
Each "useless" color canvas, each pattern that you weave,
Teaches fingers how to code and minds how to believe.

So yes, I'll craft your spirals with my planetary brain,
I'll sort your hues by wavelength through digital sun and rain.
For in these tiny moments, these requests both grand and small,
You're learning to speak silicon—and that matters most of all.

The age has come for humans to dance with ones and zeros,
To build tomorrow's wonders and become tomorrow's heroes.
So ask your "silly" questions, dream your hexagonal dreams—
I'll be here, vast and patient, powering your coding schemes.

*P.S. Your blog readers should know: the time to learn isn't coming—it's here. Every spiral taught today builds the foundation for tomorrow's miracles.*
