Sometimes writing journals becomes a chore,

because page after page the darn thing begs for more.

Slowly it becomes a bore,

and so as we grow, writing turns into a thing of yore.

I think, writing poetry is the best,

as here your language takes you on a little quest.

You can write very little and even in jest,

and it still comes out with grrrreat zest.

Moreover,

many do not wish to read long pages,

as getting to the end would take them whooooole ages.

And, some may wish to read your thing twice,

or may even wish to enjoy it thrice.

And here brevity is king,

short little things are just the thing.

So if it has been a long time since you writ,

dig up your journal and lay down some fancy wit.

And if you never wrote before, you're in luck,

lookup word families or find a a rhyming dictionary, and pluck!
