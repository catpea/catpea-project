Going from Obese to Bodybuilder is not a hard journey,
and it isn’t one that you will ever regret.

But you will have to quit your job,
and bid farewell to all the toxic things in your life.

As soon as you can,
start by getting your hiking and camping gear together.

You are going on adventures like no tomorrow,
it is the lifestyle change that ends your overeating.

And ultimately you want to set your aim,
at crossing the Appalachian Trail.

At first, keep your adventures,
confined to state parks, enjoy yourself.

Begin paying attention to your endurance,
how your body adapts, and helps you walk longer.

I always say that we are walking machines,
but what I really mean, is that we are endurance machines.

It meas that the harder you challenge your body,
the more it will transform to face the challenge.

---

You should also know that all the extra weight you carried,
is something that bodybuilders need equipment for.

You are in fact a hidden bodybuilder,
and should protect your muscles as you burn fat.

Because when you fat is gone,
you will be very muscular from all the walking and working out.

---

A workout at the gym is the same as endurance walking,
but there you use dumbbells to weigh your entire body down.

And at first you will only be able to lift for seconds,
but that will very quickly change, as your body always listens to you.

Now having said that, most people at the gym do it wrong,
because they do not respect their body’s endurance mechanism.

They start lifting 25 pounds, their body will do its best,
but they will never adapt again.

They already maxed out what they can lift,
and lift it for just a few seconds which their body will ignore.

---

So you begin with the lightest dumbbells,
and focus on building up your endurance.

You have to lift them front, up and to the side,
for one hour.

At first you will rest a lot, but you must close those rest periods,
just like joggers do it – it is not jogging until it is straight through.

And only once you establish that one hour long,
largely non-stop workout.

You begin checking if your body adapted,
to the dumbbells you are working out with.

The rule is, you should lift light, but no so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy that you will be forced to stop.

And you should always move to the beats of songs,
one beat for raising your dumbbell, the next for lowering.

The faster the song and resulting dance,
the more fat you burn.

This will put you in a dance trance,
where an hour will feel like nothing.

You should aim to double your duration,
an honest workout is no less than two non-stop hours.

And you work out for five days a week,
giving your self two consecutive days of rest.

---

This is a lot of motion, and your body will use all its reserves,
you will see results in weeks.

A great reward every month,
will keep you going.

You will be able to bend down and reach for things,
click your seatbelt with your left arm.

Even small cars will begin to seem spacious,
and constantly need new clothes.

---

The best part is that you can take the dumbbells outside,
or even on your hiking adventures.

You are free, and you adventure awaits.
get going, baby steps at a time,

Say “Hi” to Henry Thoreau from me,
when you get to Mount Katahdin.
