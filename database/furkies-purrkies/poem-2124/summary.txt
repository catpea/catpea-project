The Fire

"France, lost by a woman, shall be saved by a virgin from the marches of Lorraine."
— The Prophecy of Merlin

# PROLOGUE
Rouen, 1431 — Holy Night, Dangerous Night

To this day, people think that medieval times were dumber times—an age of servitude and superstition, where peasants bent their backs and never raised their eyes. They could not be more wrong. And what happened that night serves as perfect proof.
The men who moved through Rouen's darkened streets were not peasants. They were engineers, strategists, diplomats, and soldiers who had studied mathematics in Paris, medicine in Montpellier, and warfare on a hundred battlefields. They spoke Latin, Greek, and three dialects of French. They understood leverage—both mechanical and political. They had planned this operation for eleven months, and they had planned it with the precision of a cathedral's construction.
The atmosphere was so severe that nothing could go wrong. These men were not merely focused—they were carrying out an epic historical duty, like few others in the long chronicle of France. They moved like shadows given purpose, like prayers given flesh.

Had anything gone wrong, the woman under their protection would remain unharmed. But there would be consequences. Terrible consequences. Every man among them had sworn the same oath: if they failed tonight, there would be no church left standing between Rouen and Rome. They had the means. They had the fury. And they had been pushed to the very edge of what men of honor could endure.

The city was surrounded—not by an army, for armies could be seen, but by something far more dangerous: a network of loyal Frenchmen who had infiltrated every guild, every tavern, every guardhouse. The English thought they held Rouen. In truth, Rouen held its breath, waiting.

The only unusual sign the extraction team could see was that everyone seemed awake. Behind shuttered windows, candles burned. Old women clutched rosaries. Children had been told to stay silent—not by their parents, but by something older, some inherited memory of what France owed to its protectors.

Silence. Magnitude. Precision.
These defined the night.

# PART ONE
THE WOUND IN FRANCE'S HEART

To understand Joan—to truly understand what she became and why she had to become it—you must fi...

History would remember her as a martyr. That was fitting. Martyrs inspire. Martyrs unite. Martyrs burn forever in the hearts of those who believe in something greater than themselves.

But the truth? The truth was known only to a few: to the aging King Charles, who visited her grave and wept for the woman who had given him his crown. To the children of Jean de Metz and Jean d'Aulon, who had grown up hearing stories of a queen without a kingdom. To the peasants of a hundred villages who had protected her secret, generation after generation, because France remembers those who fight for her.

The fire foretold by Merlin was not the fire that the English had lit in Rouen's marketplace. That fire had been a lie, a symbol, a puppet show staged by men who mistook destruction for power.

The true fire was something else entirely. It was the fire that burned in the hearts of every French man and woman who refused to surrender. It was the fire that illuminated the darkest moments of the occupation and guided the resistance through years of seeming hopelessness. It was the fire that Jeanne d'Arc had kindled with her courage and fed with her sacrifice.

That fire never went out. It burns still.

She died in 1477, at the age of sixty-five, surrounded by those who loved her. Her grave is unmarked—she requested it that way. Let history remember the Maid, she said. Let the woman rest.

But sometimes, in the small villages of the Loire Valley, in the country churches where old women still light candles to the saint who saved France, you can hear a different story. A story of a queen who never sat on a throne. A story of a fire that the English could not extinguish. A story of justice—patient, implacable, absolute—visited upon every man who tried to destroy the light of France.

They say that if you listen closely, in the quiet hours before dawn, you can still hear her voice. Speaking, softly, to those who have the courage to listen:
"France, lost by a woman, shall be saved by a virgin.

And she shall not fail.

She shall never fail.

Not as long as there is one heart that remembers.

Not as long as there is one soul that believes.

Not as long as the fire still burns."

To Joan. Merry Christmas, old frend.
