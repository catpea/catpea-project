Some cats like thinking things through,
and pretend to be dumb while observing you.

And to prove to you that they are wise,
they actually invented the internet, as a disguise,

They often pretend to be watching birds,
while memorizing all your passwords.

They work hard thinking up various inventions,
all with genius and good intentions.

And then monitor if you are asleep yet,
to post them on the internet.

Nobody knows that a lot of the influencers,
are just cats with good awsers.

A lot of the young kittens get their stresses,
by running tiny little businesses.

A lot of digital goods,
are sold by kittens calming to be dudes.

And most of the online startups,
are just kittens pretending to be grownups.

Unlike hoomans, they always smile,
and go that extra customer-service mile.

Cats long ago infiltrated all the governments,
and have been busy making amends.

Many an experienced cat,
works as an international diplomat.

Slowly fixing education with focus on peace,
they work tirelessly to make all the conflicts cease.

They just learned to control all people with email,
it work every time without a fail.

---

Their current campaign is about reminding us to rise,
and clam wisdom and greatness as our prize.

They want you to know,
that you must grow.

And grow all the way up,
until you become a fanciful grownup.

Head in the clouds,
where you see past the shadows and shrouds.

And become a great being,
by using knowledge and wisdom as a way of seeing.

---

So why not be extra good,
and make your brilliant cat some tasty food.

They do need to send an email or two,
...a nice little wet tuna sandwich will do.

Go on, mush, mush,
and on on your way out, scratch their tush.
