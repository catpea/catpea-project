Glass Half Full, Grasshopper
Tuesday • March 25th 2025 • 7:07:03 pm

Fitness is easy, but before you begin,
you have to empty your glass.

Because everything you know,
is what didn’t work for everyone else.

---

Ladies,
have fitness figured out.

It is low calorie diet,
which also extends your lifespan.

And fast motion,
and the faster you move.

The faster,
your transformation.

---

But bodybuilding,
has been destroyed.

Both by useless myths,
and deadly practices.

You know weights are required,
and that is correct.

But everything else,
is trash.

---

If you take out the trash,
all you will be left with.

Is a rack of light dumbbells,
and the biggest muscles you got; legs.

---

How did your leg muscle,
grow so big?

From constantly,
carrying the rest of your body.

And would your legs,
become more muscular…

If you always carried,
dumbbells in your hands?

And what would you need to do,
to reliably always carry heavy.

Start in the middle of the rack,
or in the beginning?

---

And what if you,
slowly jogged with dumbbells.

Would you burn more fat,
and put on muscle?

---

And do you think dance trance,
could help?

Because that is only a matter,
of moving top the beats of songs.

It takes mind energy,
to sync lifting with music.

---

And what about overheating,
do you want to work out in a gym.

That winter, of summer,
day, night, or morning, is always hot.

Or do you want to jog,
with dumbbells, in crisp air?

---

Finally,
what will happen…

When once your body, reliably adapts.
to jogging with 5lb dumbells.

And you switch to 7.5,
and in a few months, to 10, 12.5 and 15, and 20.

Will your body continue adapting,
to no end?

---

Empty your glass,
find your muscles.

Ask how they got there,
and try guessing.

What you need to do,
to keep them growing.

---

Lastly, if you have no answers,
and nothing works.

Power-walk in crisp mornings,
with progressive heavier dumbbells as your body adapts.

Start in the beginning,
but not so light that you can lift more.

And never so heavy,
that they cut off your circulation and make you sit.

---

May you grow wise, become a trainer,
and save bodybuilding.
