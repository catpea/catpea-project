What if you pick an hour long jogging route, and,
develop the endurance necessary to jog through it non stop…

...and then,
instead of settling into your routine.

You put on light ankle weights and a light weight-vest,
and begin pushing your endurance again.

But this time to jog the route weighted down,
and carrying a 5lb dumbbell in each hand.

And what if, you continue adding heavier and heavier weights,
one or two pounds at a time as your body adapts?

---

What do you think your body will do,
to adapt to the gently but ever increasing weight?

---

You will certainly need nutrition that supports,
growing muscle and serving energy.

Meat and rice, or potatoes,
and vegetables.

And vegetable juice that restores electrolytes,
that your body foolishly loses by sweating.

---

But will your body stop you,
from gently adding more and more weights?

Or will it adapt to the workload,
and use the enhanced nutrition to build muscle to support your activity?

---

All joggers grow leg muscles,
to support their activity.

But joggers that don’t weigh themselves down,
plateau right when they can run their entire route.

Those who slowly keep adding weights,
dumbbell, and west weights… force their body to adapt.

And that means using up all fat for energy,
and growing muscle that can handle the challenge.

---

Eventually the weigh of dumb ells will be so heavy,
that they will demand slower and more careful motion.

Here, if you want even larger muscles,
you will need a gym, where you can dance with dumbbells.

Dancing is a lot more stable,
and unlike jogging can be as slow as needed.

And if gym does not sound fun,
in contrast to open air jogging with dumbbells.

You simply plateau, wherever you are at with your weights,
and keep the muscles you have.

---

So call it an experiment,
and this year add light dumbbells to your jog.

Start with maybe,
less than 5lb. Per hand.

And if you like the results,
use wrist weights to increase your weight a pound at a time.

Until you are lifting 7.5lb, 10, 12.5, and 15,
straight through the hour, and then double the duration of your jog.

Maybe triple, and experiment with gently!
adding more challenges like the weight vest and ankle weights.

Even if you are a slow jogger,
you are only dumbbells away from becoming a bodybuilder.
