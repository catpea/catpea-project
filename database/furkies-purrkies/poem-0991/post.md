upgrades everything.

The more you know,
the more you grow.

The more you rise,
the more the multitudes you contain.

And that means art,
and it means composing music.

And it means programming,
and writing and poetry.

In wisdom, you can tell,
that a Projector is necessary.

In wisdom you can tell,
all the pieces of a song apart.

You can look into things,
where everything is a concept map.

You can connect and reconnect,
and grow pixels to become notes of a pretty song.

In wisdom you love a good fire,
with a good view of the sunset.

And there is nothing better,
to teach you about writing and poetry.

You just put the positive together,
and the positive will piece the rest.

---

You learn to love complexity,
and programming, is like in nature.

You see a tree for what it is,
a thing that exists because it can exist well.

---

And in the morning,
on a well rested mind.

You weave a new adventure,
a new invention.

I think someday it may turn out, that self education,
is the __only__ kind of education.
