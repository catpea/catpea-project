A systems upgrade,
upgrades everything.

The more you know,
the more you grow.

The more you rise,
the more the multitudes you contain.

---

And that means art,
and it means composing music.

And it means programming,
and writing and poetry.

---

In wisdom, you can tell,
that a Projector is necessary.

In wisdom you can tell,
all the pieces of a song apart.

You can look into things,
where everything is a concept map.

You can connect and reconnect,
and grow pixels to become notes of a pretty song.

---

In wisdom you love a good fire,
with a good view of the sunset.

And there is nothing better,
to teach you about writing and poetry.

You just put the positive together,
and the positive will piece the rest.

---

You learn to love complexity,
and programming, is like in nature.

You see a tree for what it is,
a thing that exists because it can exist well.

---

And in the morning,
on a well rested mind.

You weave a new adventure,
a new invention.

---

I think someday it may turn out, that self education,
is the __only__ kind of education.
