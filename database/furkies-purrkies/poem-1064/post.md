Get a beat sequencer,
and lay down some beat.

Let it play until you feel the need,
the need for subtle variation and repetition.

Sample, some tiny part of some song,
and use that as your beat.

Keep it simple,
but keep it changing.

Don’t listen to people that tell you,
sampling is bad, they are just mean.

---

Get a wall projector,
and some acrylic paint.

Project selfies, or panoramas,
and make them part of your room.

Don’t even tell your parents,
they’ll love it.

“It is art Mother”,
and quickly add “It is not a phase.”

---

And then do a huge mural in your parents bedroom,
of sexy George Costanza, where he is striking a pose on the couch.

Murals are far more powerful than canvas,
a wall projector is a powerful tool.

While I am somewhat joking a little bit,
there is a beautiful rule of art that you should be aware of.

“Baffle The Archaeologists,”
when they study your parent bedroom 4,000 years from now.

And discover your frescos,
you wan them them vehemently scribbling in their notebooks.

---

And don’t let anybody anybody stop you from creating funny or happy things,
answering a call of creativity, is precious.

You will never forget those days,
and they in turn will make you more beautiful.

---

Get your mittens on deep-learning Art Generators,
which help you create art with text-to-image prompts.

Use words like, ornate, intricate, hyper detailed, exquisite, etched gold,
emblazoned, gold filigree, iridescent, translucent, gemstones and diamonds,luxury, clockwork

And just let it flow,
let your art grow.

Ignore the critics, the thumbs down,
and all their immature whining.

Art is anything that blooms,
with your touch.

---

Take to adventure,
backpack, tent, walking stick.

Bring all your narrated books with you,
and travel the universe.

Listen and re-listen,
laugh and wonder.

Some people believe that the ancient myths,
truly spoke a great wisdom.

When the hero sets of on an impossible adventure,
it is not just about triumph, but mostly about growing up.

---

If you don’t listen to your curiosities,
you are not going to be able to move forward.

Growing up requires that we advance,
in all the things that call to us.

And life is far too precious,
to grow only part way up.

You have to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.
