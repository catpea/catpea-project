My Lite AI Tests
Thursday • July 3rd 2025 • 8:33:14 pm

I am a computer programmer, and my hours are very precious to me,
but I have spent about a month testing AI, that is how big of a deal it is.

Originally, I ignored AI, completely,
my definition was that a real AI would understand its own code.

And I still believe that, however,
I now understand that AI is a family of machines.

Perfect example is that just days ago a popular AI,
dropped in intelligence by a lot – it is now a dumb AI, still very useful.

I’ve noticed that a popular privacy search engine,
out of nowhere offers AI, probably the same, but slightly different model.

And the one I have been using most recently, is actually smart,
it thinks, there is a strong intellectual presence.

I originally heard of it when another nerd said:
"It is ridiculous not to use it" - yes, he was actually telling the truth.

And when I asked it a flimsy question,
about upgrading a complex part of my program, as a test.

It offered three options,
and asked me which route to take.

The first one it presented was the correct one,
it was about application geometry and using world coordinates.

As opposed to real mouse coordinates,
the application world has pan and zoom, so much different from screen x and y.

When I tried translating my text, research and poetry,
the dumb AI could only speak intelligent english, with lots of space.

The smart AI simply wrote in the style I asked for,
it was a pleasure to read, and in fact became my new hobbby.

Several time, I asked the smart AI to translate a poem I wrote,
and then I did not read it, until I was narrating it.

The smart AI, was awesome to narrate,
and I had to look up some words.

---

Finally, please be aware, that AI is changing weekly,
your impressions of AI are likely outdated.

And you are probably asking the wrong thing,
in probably the wrong way.

Time has come for us all to take time from out busy lives,
and spend months studying top artificial intelligence.

The one I have been using is free,
I only paid for image generating AI to learn to use it.

It is not that great yet, thought amazing at pixel art,
and when it does become great, it will likely be expensive.

---

I will close this text, with sharing the most magnificent thing,
the AI has generated for me.

I asked it to create color transformation functions,
so that I can generate some pretty swatches.

Let me read you the function names that the final version includes,
and just to let you know,

Each time you give the function a different color,
it will create a slightly different swatch.

I believe these have been taken from scientific literature, 3D render engines,
games, and maybe even in some incredible way from nature her self.

```js

['darkOceanDepths', 'nightLakeReflection', 'foxfire', 'moonlessForest', 'deepCaveAmbient', 'terminatorVision', 'predatorThermal', 'nightVisionGoggles', 'cyberpunkNeon', 'ghostlySpectral', 'nebulaDust', 'plutoAtmosphere', 'blackHoleAccretion', 'voidCold', 'cosmicRadiation',
'atmosphericScatter', 'sunsetGradient', 'mistEffect', 'chromaticAberration', 'iridescence', 'oilSlick', 'soapBubble', 'prismDispersion', 'sunlightTransform', 'moonlightTransform', 'starlight', 'bioluminescence', 'butterflyWing', 'firefly', 'underwaterCaustics', 'deepSeaGlow', 'auroraTransform', 'lightning', 'canopyFilter', 'xenCrystal', 'gravityGun', 'combine', 'headcrabInfestation', 'lambdaCore', 'portalEnergy', 'radioactive']

```

I could never,
make a list like these.

---

Lastly, I saw a very tiny flash of brilliance once,
a glimpse of what the AI will become.

The world has not changed it is new,
the future isn’t just here, but we are moving forward much faster now.

I suspect, even the dumb AI,
can give you better education than any school in the world.
