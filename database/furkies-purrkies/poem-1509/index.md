"Ancient Egyptians knew,
and celebrated cats as gods."

---

The scientific proof comes in the shape
of a characteristic that runs rare in the animal kingdom.

Something that extremely intelligent beings,
simply can’t handle, and that is the feeling of being dusty or dirty.

Now mind you, we are talking about hyper intelligence,
that humans can take a dust bath, just means we are less intelligent than cats.

Cats can’t handle dirt in large part, because they are already stressed out,
about constantly pretending they are less intelligent than us.

---

Now the many astute thinkers that are still listening to this,
will pose some question about common behaviors contrary to these claims.

Hyper intelligent animals, who chose not to revel their intelligence,
will still try to say a few things.

Although, in a way that can be explained,
as normal animal behavior.

So when your kitty, does that quick lick,
they are making that old familiar suggestion, so that you bug off.

When you see kitties yelling at birds, a behavior never shown towards mice,
they are actually just really upset have to yell, upwards.

Your kitty knows you in a detail far greater,
then even your closest family, sometimes they just need to scream at something.

Why would a cat bring you a mouse,
well let me ask you this.

Imagine being super smart,
so smart that you know it is trouble to reveal that.

And yet still needing to call your bestie a chunky chunkerton ,
and give commentary about smaller portions, more protein and less carbs.

And if they let the mouse loose, and you have to run around the house to catch it,
that my dear listener, is how your hyper intelligent fren tells you to exercise.

Cats have an incredible sense of humor,
that is why they love what you perceive as causing trouble.

We are just not hyper intelligent enough,
to see the comedy in their hi-jinks – we just don’t get it.

Which brings us to the unfortunate subjects of the leaf,
and the other kind of lick.

Scientists that study feline behavior, time and again have proven,
that when a feline licks the rear, especially while making eye contact.

They are calling you a filthy creature,
still in a loving way, but you should, immediately, take a shower.

Which brings us to the leaf, and there is no clean way,
to clearly describe why your kitty would bring you a leaf.

Therefore,
we must use an analogy, so listen carefully.

Imagine a quiet evening,
when you want to watch a good movie.

So, you make some popcorn,
and peanut butter an jelly sandwiches.

And cheerfully march back to your living room,
unfortunately right as you are sitting down on your couch.

A massive dollop of warm peanut butter,
lands on the shag carpeting surrounding your couch.

What do you do, well, you go get a little square of flimsy paper,
give it a wipe, and call it a job well done.

When you receive the leaf, not only do you need a shower,
but also a trip to the hardware store to get a bidet attachment for your toilet.

Frankly, by the time your cat starts bringing you leaves,
you need to get the hose type, not the gentle little mist.

Hyper intelligence also means hyper smell,
their sense of small is at least nine times more powerful than yours.

That means when they are nine feet away form you,
they small you as if they were right next to you.

And if they are right next to you,
then you better wash.

Now, as per agreement, I must stress that your kitty cats,
want fresh food, without any bone, prepared by hand, and not out of a can.

They need you to know that dry food is extremely unfair,
and low quality fish is trashy, they live with you, expecting more than trash.

This is just the one demand that they have,
cook for them, and remember to pick out every bit of sharp bone.

Never, ever, think to yourself,
that you are just feeding the cat.

Your cats are sharing their lives with you,
think in terms of  sharing food with them (so as long as it is healthy for kitties to eat).

Your kitty wants the nice version, of what they normally eat in the wild,
and yes, they want a tiny little side salad, they love exploring greens a litte.

Your cat is not a smelly ape with shag-confusion,
that is OK living on soda and potato chips.

Your cat is a lot more complex,
more intellectually sophisticated than they seem, and yet still loves you.

Please honor, respect,
and learn more about your kitties.

Because they unquestionably honor,
and certainly learn more about you each and every day.
