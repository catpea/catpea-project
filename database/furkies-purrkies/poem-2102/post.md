Let us define the terms first,
because neither are what you think.

Bodybuilding is an antiaging technique, it extends life,
in the age of sugars and obesity, it may doubles the lifespan.

Music,
or more specifically drums, is a tool of war.

Dance enhances the dancers, making them more efficient,
at the terrible things warriors must do to return home, or protect their people.

When you see people training for martial arts,
they say the same thing together or copy their trainer or routine.

That is what happened when you come to the gym,
without clear music.

You can’t wait to leave,
trainer may need to remind you to finish your workout.

But when you replace numbered routines, trainers, and boredom,
wit slow at first beats of drums, spices with fresh sounds.

---

Time starts moving faster, you don’t have enough time to get bored,
and because the beats are telling you when to move, you have no worries.

You stop for a few seconds, when the songs switch,
put the dumbbells down to relax your arms and palms.

And you keep going,
dancing with dumbbells, flexing, enabling, restoring, building and re-building.

---

Imagine what a powerful tool in the arsenal the drums were,
physical training went from PUSH, to PULL.

Where a person is being pulled along,
to lift at precise intervals, for many yours.

---

At the gym, even the trainer gets bored,
when they see you looking at the clock, to chech when it is all over.

You make their wisdom,
feel worthless, like it is a nuisance to you.

Being trained, or not having music,
almost guarantees a a tiny and broken workout.

The music that the gym is playing,
isn't useful at all, not for a workout.

Low quality,music at a tempo that does not match your ability,
or goals, will pull you out of dance trance.

No dance trance,
no endurance based bodybuilding.

A three hour work out, instead of feeling like ten minutes,
would then feel like a 9 hour ordeal.

No one should be annoyed or distracts,
for any number of hours.

A bodybuilder,
won’t be able to workout without fresh and crisp music.

No beat, no trance,
no chance.

Very briefly now, the underlying workout I describe,
is based on an hour’s worth of hard earned jogging endurance.

And it begins with three pound dumbbells per hand,
while you continue slowly jogging for an hour non stop.

You move up in weight by no more than 2.5lb per hand,
so 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and if you want to be huge make your way up to 20lb.

The fact that you have to cycle dumbbell exercises for an hour,
before you can go higher in weight, protects you.

You have to start with three pounds,
and only advance when your body allows.

---

But slow music, is all the break you need,
every time you start lifting higher, to switch to country, or classical dance even.

You lift your dumbbells, on the side, in-front,
and you get your rest from lifting above your head.

You have to switch before your arms get really tired,
which is something I termed “choking”.

Or more illustratively,
something akin to cutting off your circulation.

---

Basically, if you ever jogged before,
you noticed how your leg muscles developed, and how quickly.

Adding dumbbells, acts on your entire musculature,
to repeat the initial process.

As you go up by 2.5 pouds, and make your way to faster music,
maybe double your workout…

Your body will be catching up to your needs,
by creating muscle, and always more than you need.

---

And though jogging and dancing with dumbbells,
are initially interchangeable.

The flexing, twisting, and turning, and stabilizing,
that dancing demands, build more muscle in more places.

It makes you young again,
it keeps your body renewing it self.

It prevents your body from,
deteriorating,

Every workout is a call to not just retain,
but refine and build new muscle.

You stimulate your joins,
to keep them healthy and renewed.

And your bones, slowing decline
stimulating bone cells to stay active.

---

But without music, that initial hour’s worth of endurance,
and gently dancing to the drims, one beat up, next beat down.

You can’t work out for long enough,
you’d get distracted and wonder away, long before asking your body to adapt.

And as always, lift light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy, that you are forced to stop.
