There is no better example of what endurance is,
than when a couch potato goes jogging.

Endurance slowly increases over time,
your body adapts, that is how real superpowers work.

This applies to every part of your body,
not just your legs.

By using dumbbells, and slowly making your way towards dancing,
you effectively end-up jogging with your legs and upper body.

---

Yes, at first, jogging is a tall, freaking order,
walking long distances, daily, is already a lot.

Appalachian trail hikers become skinny and fit,
by walking 20 miles a day with a hefty backpack, for 6 months.

Just like jogging,
walking is also infinitely enhanced by endurance.

It may take you a goodie long while,
before you cheerfully shimmy-shammy a better part of a marathon.

But the thing that is increasing your distance,
is endurance.

---

There is something magical,
about zooming around your neighborhood.

Unless you are out in the woods with beautiful vistas,
and plan on sleeping there from time to time.

Just jog, around, see what the neighbors are up to,
jog to work, jog from work, and then jog instead of work.

Like my Doctor seems to be doing,
it works.

---

At first, you won’t be able to breathe,
it will feel awful.

Until you discover, that you can actually inhale twice, in one go,
if your body aches, you can detach from it, and be brain riding a cranky mule.

If you can’t think about stopping, that is in fact proof,
that you are not a maniac, but you need to Salsa.

To be precise, if you must stop, OK, but then you dance,
you take a internet video tutorial about Shuffle Dancing and dance.

---

Stopping is a way of telling you body,
to cease adapting to your workouts, to stop increasing endurance.

If you feel weird about dancing in the street,
make your jog end at a gym, dance, and then walk or jog home, keep moving.

When you keep moving, you are signaling to your body,
that you want it to adapt to the daily new load.

It seems to strengthen whatever muscles you got,
which will make you last longer, and then you will start growing new muscles.

Which will give you superhuman strength,
which again will increase your endurance, and so on.

It is very sad that first workouts are painful,
but that pain is not there because of the workout.

It is there because you are not in shape,
we are animals, great apes, not being in shape is bad juju.

The problem of pain is that you sank down, into a numb existence,
and become out of shape.

If you continued running around like a little kid,
which is what healthy athletes do, then your body would not hurt.

The pain does not mean that exercise is painful,
but that you drove your body in such a state that it can’t run around anymore not without pain at first.

The pain is temporary of course, fit people are not in pain,
they feel great, and they always have energy, and a classy sense of humor.

So as long as you are slowly but mathematically increasing your endurance,
you won’t even notice when the pain goes away.

You will be too healthy,
to care.

To mathematically increase your endurance,
is to either use an interval timer, or a stop watch and a map.

Eat like a normal person,
protein powders are suspicious, just eat well.

Because workout need to be daily, coffee and sugar, become a huge problem,
because you can’t cancel a workout for any reason, including a headache.

There are no shortcuts when recovering from a sedimentary lifestyle,
in fact, if you are of the mindset where you are searching for one, you will not recover.

Endurance is you, it is your sacred fountain of youth,
every step you take must be authentic, or you will fall apart, there are no shortcuts.

Remember, when you cannot jog, dance with dumbbells in your hands,
and when you cannot dance... gyrate, but never stop.
