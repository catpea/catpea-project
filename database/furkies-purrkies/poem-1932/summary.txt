Become A Genius With This Powerful Meditation Technique

Above all, there is a division that is rarely discussed,
it is a line between people who enjoy fantasy and people who chose reality.

Therefore we must explain what false beliefs look like,
to get at the technique, otherwise you are likely to retain a shallow understanding of meditation.

Let us begin with a simple example, a deck of cards,
Tarot is a scam practiced by fantasy fortune tellers to make money.

I once sat next to a young lady who to my shock paid a lot of money,
and when we both agreed that it wasn’t a real reading.

She, very wisely, ended the conversation with just saying,
“she told me what I wanted to hear”.

This is what the church is, one of the Atheists was surprised to discover,
that most people don’t believe in god.

But they do believe in believing in god, which means friends,
ceremonies and occasions, escape from loneliness, and some hope somehow.

I was greatly offended my last Christmas visit to a church decades ago,
when a collection basket was pushed into every person at the church.

This was a Detroit church, and the basket wasn't passed around,
already a pretty nasty thing to do, this basket was on a pole.

Pushed into every person there, to shame them for not giving,
this is the same thing the fortune teller does, is a person is not forthcoming.

Psychologist, the same ones, call it harmless, but it is not,
war after war, personal horror after horror, it has shown it self not to be harmless.

The new atheists that sprung up after the attacks on New York,
explained that moderate religion justifies existence of more extreme version.

But greatest harm it causes, is just as invisible as indoctrination,
as in you can’t know what you are missing.

Religion worse than ineffective schools gives an impression of education,
it discourages you from digging deep into the universe.

As badly as the people who call education “white”,
or as that one politician said, learning is not something her people do.

Σωκράτης was born 470 years before the characters from the Bible,
and he was murdered for standing up to the State.

He was teaching your people how to think critically,
how to question everything, inducing the existence of their gods.

He died to stand up for thinking and asking,
and prevent R...

... to learn for real.

And you begin learning programming,
by bringing old game development techniques to the web browser.

---

Once you start [learning JavaScript][3] you will have reached a new level,
then you may [use game engines ][4].

Or go wild, [make your game out of SVG graphics][5],
[following ideas from the Another World game][6].

Don’t listen to people saying SVG is slow,
it is just a markup language a subset can easily work on top of everything.

You can also [use the canvas][7],
like everyone else.

Unlike the fake empty your mind , or mindfull meditation,
whatever that is.

The real meditation demands years or decades,
of you enjoying your your learning challenges.

Of you bringing beauty into the digital world,
here I ask of you to make a series of games about Socrates.

---

Discover the true story of humanity,
switch to the real world.

Master fantasy as an expression of the beauty of your wisdom,
instead of a way to speed-run life, and find nothing past the end.

You can easily imagine, how year after year,
your mind will become sharper and more powerful.

This isn’t just meditation for genius,
it is also a meditation for art from the [Demoscene][8] and [Chiptine Music][9].

You have never see more color and beauty, than what you are about to image
in search for color themes and characters for your [pixel art][8] demos and games.

Please understand that you are meant to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

Learning Philosophy and Programming,
are just your first steps, but you’ll know where to go from here.
