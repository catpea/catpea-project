Above all, there is a division that is rarely discussed,
it is a line between people who enjoy fantasy and people who chose reality.

Therefore we must explain what false beliefs look like,
to get at the technique, otherwise you are likely to retain a shallow understanding of meditation.

Let us begin with a simple example, a deck of cards,
Tarot is a scam practiced by fantasy fortune tellers to make money.

I once sat next to a young lady who to my shock paid a lot of money,
and when we both agreed that it wasn’t a real reading.

She, very wisely, ended the conversation with just saying,
“she told me what I wanted to hear”.

This is what the church is, one of the Atheists was surprised to discover,
that most people don’t believe in god.

But they do believe in believing in god, which means friends,
ceremonies and occasions, escape from loneliness, and some hope somehow.

I was greatly offended my last Christmas visit to a church decades ago,
when a collection basket was pushed into every person at the church.

This was a Detroit church, and the basket wasn't passed around,
already a pretty nasty thing to do, this basket was on a pole.

Pushed into every person there, to shame them for not giving,
this is the same thing the fortune teller does, is a person is not forthcoming.

Psychologist, the same ones, call it harmless, but it is not,
war after war, personal horror after horror, it has shown it self not to be harmless.

The new atheists that sprung up after the attacks on New York,
explained that moderate religion justifies existence of more extreme version.

But greatest harm it causes, is just as invisible as indoctrination,
as in you can’t know what you are missing.

Religion worse than ineffective schools gives an impression of education,
it discourages you from digging deep into the universe.

As badly as the people who call education “white”,
or as that one politician said, learning is not something her people do.

Σωκράτης was born 470 years before the characters from the Bible,
and he was murdered for standing up to the State.

He was teaching your people how to think critically,
how to question everything, inducing the existence of their gods.

He died to stand up for thinking and asking,
and prevent Religion based exploitation, control and horror.

The Plationic Academy, or the University of Athens,
was founded 387 before the events of the bible.

Among thousands of other stories,
the Platonic Academy and Socrates influenced religions that were created.

---

It is such a tragedy, that these organizations do not teach effective knowledge,
an act that would bring the world peace, and return wisdom to the pulpit.

---

There are two worlds, a world of truth,
and a world of easy and comfortable fantasy, that charges you money.

And takes advantage of lonely old people,
many churches expect great gifts, to their portfolio.

---

Tarot cards too have a decent reason for existence,
people across entire history of the world would use cards to check perspectives.

For example the modern, young entrepreneur,
often pulls out the reality card, asking.

“What problem does this fix,
and do people really have it.”

With a stack of such cards, you can easily see how a thinker,
will not get stuck, and infarct may be elevated.

The fraudsters too bring in some wisdom, when a death card,
or the fool comes out, and this helps them speak.

But, generic advice that pleases someone for money,
is a dirty thing.

Tarot-like cards for entrepreneurs, would work if they were sufficiently wise,
and they are still better than diagrams or back of the envelope-scribbling.

---

It would be an easy fix to the world.
if we could turn the church into a University Of Science, Wisdom and Greatness.

And make some card stacks, not unlike what kids get at the Supermarket,
that would really serve up powerful perspectives and tools for thinking.

I leave that up to you dear reader,
for putting you through all the opening thoughts just to get to the sweet part.

Real and effective meditation actually exists, it is really,
and it will really make you a genius.

But just like Tarot and the Church,
it is nothing like what the pretenders teach.

Let me explain this with an example of a grand mother,
who is seeking to energize her mind and imagination.

It begins with a nin-tendo, exactly what the grand-kids would love,
but instead of playing the beautiful pixel art games.

She studies them, the frames of the characters, the layer in the background,
the motion that gives an impression of depth.

And the million little tiny details,
that hide fun little strategies worth her study time.

If you are like me, and it is all too flashy and complex,

And as you sit there, trying to figure out the game mechanics,
that made those computers so lovely.

Know that you have reached your first level of mediation,
it works because it is interesting, and you are doing something other than playing.

Real meditation, won’t make you are genius,
without real self education, at a pace you will never see in school.

To become a real genius,
you have to learn for real.

And you begin learning programming,
by bringing old game development techniques to the web browser.

---

Once you start [learning JavaScript][3] you will have reached a new level,
then you may [use game engines ][4].

Or go wild, [make your game out of SVG graphics][5],
[following ideas from the Another World game][6].

Don’t listen to people saying SVG is slow,
it is just a markup language a subset can easily work on top of everything.

You can also [use the canvas][7],
like everyone else.

Unlike the fake empty your mind , or mindfull meditation,
whatever that is.

The real meditation demands years or decades,
of you enjoying your your learning challenges.

Of you bringing beauty into the digital world,
here I ask of you to make a series of games about Socrates.

---

Discover the true story of humanity,
switch to the real world.

Master fantasy as an expression of the beauty of your wisdom,
instead of a way to speed-run life, and find nothing past the end.

You can easily imagine, how year after year,
your mind will become sharper and more powerful.

This isn’t just meditation for genius,
it is also a meditation for art from the [Demoscene][8] and [Chiptine Music][9].

You have never see more color and beauty, than what you are about to image
in search for color themes and characters for your [pixel art][8] demos and games.

Please understand that you are meant to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

Learning Philosophy and Programming,
are just your first steps, but you’ll know where to go from here.
