For your muscles to grow,
you must constantly challenge them.

You have to move more and faster,
lift heavier, longer, and eliminate rest.

And you have to do so wisely,
because injury is failure.

---

You have to move to the beat of music,
to enter a trance like state.

Same kind of state you enter,
when driving home from work.

The music playlist has to be interesting,
the songs need to be fresh.

Music is your primary source of energy,
and focus, nothing will fork better.

---

You can’t switch machines,
you can’t 8isolate muscles.

You can’t move your towel or bottle,
you focus, narrow down, clamp down.

And gracefully, challenge your body,
with just the dumbbells.

Lifting palms down, to the side,
above head and relying on bicep curls for rest.

---

And most importantly, you must first develop,
an hour or two long non-stop routine.

With lightest weights,
or even no weights.

---

All of this combines to help you,
finish your daily two or three hours.

Whether you are restoring your body,
rejuvenating yourself, or building muscle.

---

To initially eliminate your rest periods,
and gain the endurance necessary for a non stop hour.

You use an interval timer,
a free app or a cheap no brand name clip-on.

Just as soon as you can move for an hour,
you start increasing your dumbbell weight.

From no dumbbells to two pounds,
or from three pounds to five pounds.

If you have to stop,
your dumb bells are too heavy.

Mix in lighter weight,
or use your interval timer again.

But keep dancing,
don’t stop moving.

---

If I had to give an estimate,
I’d say this is 10 times faster than sets and reps.

Sets and reps are a bodybuilding myth,
that roughly states lift three sets, of ten lifts.

With even more myth piled on top,
like moving up by 5 pounds, or super-sets.

The myth persists for the same reason,
that boys artificially lower the tone of their voice to sound manly.

Nobody wants to walk into a gym,
and start dancing with two pound dumbbells.

On top of that, nobody wants to stand,
because standing is hard.

People want to sit and lay,
and look professional, like they know the secret.

That is why the myth of sets and reps persists,
everyone is ashamed, hoping to pretend to be more.

---

When you first sign up at the gym,
it is OK to sit, it is important to look at what people are doing.

I recommend showing up at different times of day,
just to see what is going on.

But after a few days, if you want to advance,
you must copy the joggers.

But instead of running with your feet,
you grab onto the dumbbells.

Dumbbells are a full body excessive,
as you move to music all your muscles perform an orchestra.

But like joggers, you are not exercising,
until you can go on non-stop for an hour, and then two or three.

---

The non stop hour is the heart of your excessive,
but it also serves as a diagnostic.

It will reveal to you if you are lifting too much weight.
by making you stop and rest.

Too much is very bad, it cuts off your circulation,
and then does something worse that demands rest, that makes you weak.

The reason why nobody grows muscles twice,
or continues growing muscle – is because they lift too heavy.

They stop for insane amounts of time,
so much so that as far as the body is concerned.

It is the equivalent of lifting 5 pounds,
for 15 minutes, and going home.

If they list 65 pounds in some dangerous way,
for 15 seconds, it is just dangerous maintenance not advancement.

On the other hand, the reason joggers,
don’t keep growing leg muscles.

Is because they never add more weight,
they usually hope to run faster.

---

You add just enough weight not to be able to add more,
and never not so much, that it will make you stop.

---

Sets and reps of lifting heavy few times,
has destroyed the gym, progress, self esteem, and many incredible futures.

Sets and reps are a myth,
an unfortunate myth.

---

Finally, if you have fat to burn,
rather than lifting what you can for an hour.

You should lift your medium weight, not too light not too heavy,
but much faster than your heavy, euro-dance fast.

Lifting your non-stop hour maximum, is slow,
because it challenges your muscles.

To burn fat you have to be out of breath,
you have to gradually train to move super-fast.

Get rid of your scale, because you will still be gaining muscle,
while you are burning fat.

Skinny, fat or fit, the bodybuilder food is dried fruit and nuts,
avoid dried fruits soaked in processed sugar as that is just candy.

If you are large eat little,
but not so little that you don’t have energy to work out.

You will need protein too, obesity gave you muscle,
you have to feed them protein, to retain them as you burn fat.

Once your diet is healthy,
it is your non stop hour or two, that will burn your fat.

If you are skinny, think of bodybuilding as an endurance sport,
gently, add a weight vest, ankle weights, and go on walks.

A weight vest, may just give you abdominal muscles,
entirely from just waking around with your vest.

When in doubt, remember this one word:
“gradually”.

Meaning that you constantly, but gradually,
challenge your muscles, by adjusting all the tiny details of everything you do.
