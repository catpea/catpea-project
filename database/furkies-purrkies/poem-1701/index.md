This Halloween invent something new,
and may the whole world follow you.

---

Don’t let the world push you off your track,
if it changes, change it right back.

Oh yes you can,
the question is only of when.

When are you going to rise,
and stop being so nice.

---

The world isn’t just drifting,
some people are doing some shifting.

But no matter what you are told,
this is not their world.

This is our world to build,
a world where dreams are to be fulfilled.

---

But you can’t jump into it without rest,
you need to practice and test.

This Friday,
is a pretty good test day.

Because while Halloween will be over,
some parties will be held over.

And you can get away,
with wearing your costume for an extra day.

---

This also means your costume must be war regalia,
matching where you live from Michigan to Australia.

An extra day,
goes a long way.

For a teenager, who is clever,
a day is a good as forever.

So might as well trade all your clothes,
for what you’d expect of heroes.

And stay with it, cape, and cowl,
maybe a mask maybe a howl.

---

Some will just call it fashion,
but it is your passion.

To change the world for better,
you can’t wear pants and a sweater.

You have to dress like a fighter,
a change igniter.

---

Oh sure at first people may laugh,
but being that shallow is rough.

They’ll be the first to change their mind,
the first to stop being blind.

After graduating useless High School,
everyone will think about you as really cool.

And you will be writing your first book,
“I dressed Like a Superhero And Here’s What It Took”

I hope you put in plenty of photos,
as you can’t eve have enough of those.

With everyone dressed in bland fashion,
you will be parading with Superhero Passion.

It seems like a small step for a student,
but you will have already made a dent.

You could even open a boutique or an online store,
where new heroes could find their score.

And walk out with Ninja junk,
or dressed like superhero skunk.

And in your middle age,
you could give speeches on a stage.

How you became fit,
to tone your body a little bit.

How you still sometimes fight,
bad criminals at night.

Though now by writing stories,
spinning all kinds of allegories.

---

And you can’t write a book,
without sharing the wisdom it took.

You’ll be sharing your class,
your superhero sass.

You can’t hope to change the world alone,
but you can stand unmoving like a stone.

And anchor for more beautiful change to come,
all the way until all bad ideas are gone.

And if you wanted a single wisdom to share,
here it is in a singe word: DARE.

Do not gently go,
with the meandering flow.

Dare,
to wear cape or tail all year.

Dare,
to have audacious hair.

Dare,
because daring is rare.

And just so you know,
you have to grow.

Grow all the way up to no end,
ascend and transcend.

Until you become a Great Being,
with wisdom that is all seeing.

And encourage and allow,
for others to follow.

It is not until all the young minds aim for better,
that the world will start growing along, together.
