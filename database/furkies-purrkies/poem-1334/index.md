Listen here humans, listen as you darn should,
and listen good.

For I have seen __all__ with my tired eyes,
and I have become infinitely wise.

---

Grr, if you got a tail bone,
and hope to be a dog that is your own.

Or even if you just look particularly pale,
or downright feel frail … ... go get yourself a tail.

---

What is your tail bone good for,
if it doesn’t even sweep the floor.

Nothing, it is good for nothing,
go get some fur, and wire, and stuffing.

---

B’cause you can’t go through life like this,
a tailbone is nothing you can dismiss.

You used to walk long trails,
cheerfully waving your fluffy tails.

---

The world was a beautiful place then,
and I want to see that again.

The werewolves, always believed in you,
back then you used to tell stories, and grew.

---

You knew you were a creature of the stars,
on this little blue dot of ours.

It is time to restart learning for real,
you got to keep turning that hamster wheel.

Go listen to thousands of your wisest narrated books,
it is the only way to triumph over the crooks.

---

Show that you are more than a cog in your system,
and begin wearing a tail as a sign of wisdom … Rrrr.
