As long as you follow your own star,
adventure is never all that far.

And do months of adventure and travel,
or you mind will soften and unravel.

Every year, prepare and repeat,
and you will become an athlete.

Spring is short 73 Michigan days away,
and I am yet to put my summer clothes away.

Winter is not what it used to be,
and that's alright with me.

But with 5 days until Groundhog Day,
I can already tell what that he is going to say.

The rumor is they make hats of them when they are wrong,
so I hope he stays strong.

He just wants to sleep all day,
and what would a groundhog know anyway?

I predict an early Spring,
the birds are already starting to sing.

With spring this close,
there is no need to shop for winter clothes.

I dreamed of Nordhouse Dunes again,
my Raccoon friend Friday from way back when.

I could swear,
I could smell the warm Autumn air.

I’d always stay the Summer and then some,
returning sunny and handsome.

If there is any adventure left in you,
then consider hiking the AT straight through.

Fist day of Spring is their big day,
some start earlier to blaze the way.

I suppose it’s up to that lazy dog,
our strange fat groundhog.

One thing is clear,
visit your favorite trail every year.

And if you love it,
then take good care of it.

For, so as long as you don’t quit.
it will keep you young and fit.
