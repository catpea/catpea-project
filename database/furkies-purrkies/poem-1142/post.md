When we say that things outside of natural selection, evolve,
we mean to say that certain patterns develop layer by layer around obstacles.

Sometimes these patters even come with a proper camouflage,
it is hard to see the wrongs, manipulation or deceptions.

The energy that fuels these patters,
is often a plain multi-generational want for something.

The most illustrative example are the thousands of religions that we invented,
many survive to this day, because they are that good at evasion and camouflage.

Furthermore, we are genetically predisposed to unquestionably believe,
the things that we are born into.

Even though your people understand that had they been born to another family,
they would believe in other things.

Mechanisms behind this phenomena have been exploited, by religion or cults,
TV advertising, and even national governments.

Religions hope to convince people that there is no morality outside them,
and that our life is meant to be spent in servitude to imaginary friends.

And it is not until we die,
that we gt to have all the fun.

TV commercials convince us that a carcinogen so powerful,
that your dentist does not want you to rinse your mouth with it.

Is actually really, trendy, and cool, and makes you mature,
and helps you rest, and laugh, relax and become a man.

And national governments not only tricked you int that poverty is your fault,
but also to die in war for god an country.

We live in a dark age, and many distant future historians,
will be very unforgiving, simply labeling us as living in the dark ages.

Education, along with erasure of poverty is our only way out,
this means that even if we create the perfect school, it will fail…

Unless, the students are granted a safe home, life long daily allowance,
and the ability to travel and switch neighborhoods.

This similar to student exchange, but it is also about a network of homes,
where people can trade places, until they find a neighborhood they love.

This means that without the serenity of perfect guarantee of safety, freedom, and security,
our minds will not be able to fully flourish in brilliance required for real education.

Being stubborn and rebellious, is a sure way around this problem,
but it is very demanding, and he human mind is sweet and delicate.

While it is possible, to rage for knowledge, wisdom and greatness,
asking the younger generations to do that, is a disgrace and a tragedy.

Schools have evolved camouflage, to disrupt you ability to see,
how fraudulent they have become.

In part it is the stress of low GPA, of constant threat of ridicule,
or being held back, and being told that we won’t be able to find a job and die in the street.

And in part, that the subject divisions have evolved, layer by layer,
to make us feel like we the hard effort we put in helps us advance…

But in reality, the subject divisions pus us away from integrated knowledge,
which today we know as rare, under the impossible name “genius”.

Today the path towards real education and exceptional ability,
will never result in a diploma, or a resume to compete with the less honest students.

A less honest student is one who will quietly invite a reporter friend,
to for example a “Programming for charity event”, and have a secret interview.

Which then makes it into the back of a newspaper,
a clipping of which will forever grace his resume.

The tragedy is this path, are best captured in the tone and words,
of the guidance counselor, right before the student walks out “You will ruin your lifer and never get a job”

This way around fake education is called Self Education,
it includes travel and adventure with narrated books in ear.

And learning programming, because it is the safest, fastest, and most powerful way out of poverty.

Painting, portraits, sculpture, music composition, bodybuilding, writing,
cannot compare to the ability to create small portable businesses, that require no warehousing, or upfront investment.

Finally, even after you become wise and learn to look towards greatness,
and finally complete a series of business undertakings that secure your future.

You will still face a world that is always on the brink of nuclear war,
and in an endless progression of wars begun by madmen that result in the loss of millions of lives.

And a world held captive by poverty, fake education, and cultures so driven by bad ideas,
that they cannot be worthy of the people stuck within.

Moreover, in a world of confusion where posts and news an other content,
is pumped by low quality sentiment analysis programs, liars will destroy your work.

Whatever your legacy, whatever your greatness,
it will have to be out of the reach of the ravenous, uneducated and misguided.

But know this, to grow up, always means to grow all the way up,
never part way, as your fraudulent leaders or teachers would have it.

And to grow all the way up,
is just another way of saying become a Great Being.

In your philosophical quests, as your narrated books play,
you will discover that great beings can shift the direction of the entire world.

You can be sure, that it will only take a few great minds,
to correct our course, and finally do the future generations justice.
