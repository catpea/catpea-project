We have to grow up,
and grow __all__ the way up.

Growing up,
is not aging.

Waiting for some number of years,
to feel like an adult, is dangerous, and childish.

The danger,
is in never growing up for real.

And merely thinking you are an adult,
because of the number of years that passed.

---

Growing up,
does not happen automatically.

You have to work on it,
every day.

This is called self education,
and you just listen to narrated books from the library.

There is an extreme danger,
silently slithering here.

Because if you pick the wrong books,
you will get tricked.

Reading the wrong books,
will delay your progress, sometimes by many years.

Listening to advice is also dangerous,
most people don’t know thy are uneducated.

And will give you,
the wrong recommendations.

---

People write bad books,
to make the lies they were tricked into, more believable – it is a disaster.

These books usually talk about giants, monsters, alien visitors,
all knowing all powerful creatures – stuff that scares those who don’t grow up.

---

You have to figure out who the clear thinking intellectuals of your era are,
see what books the great beings and philosophers love.

Often reading books that they wrote, is a good start,
reading books about the lives of great beings in general is pretty good bet.

Popular science books that explain the universe in lovely and friendly ways,
will help you find your footing.

And adventure books, will introduce you to the true human nature,
the nature of great warriors, and unbreakable philosophers.

---

A real book is not like a movie, where you watch it once or twice,
it is more like a burred treasure chest, that you have to dig out first.

You have to reread your books, because your first read,
will only touch on the surface, and most ideas will be too confusing to keep.

You need time to extend your mind, to kind of befriend the author,
and fully appreciate the layers of knowledge contained in the books.

---

Choose your books wisely,
and be careful of school.

Schools do not work,
they will not teach you.

They will only home to turn you into a little memorization machine,
and then a test passing machine, and then a yes machine…

And finally,
an everyone in school gets paid machine.

The first grades are still good, and the discomfort is part of learning the basics,
your reading writing, and arithmetic.

But after that, the teachers in fifth grade on up,
are different, more cunning.

---

Do not be scared of the world, its beauty scales,
with the number of people who hold authentic and profound knowledge and wisdom.

You see by learning for real,
you will be making the world more beautiful, and much safer for others.

The wisdom of every person will form a large and unique constellation,
however, all profound constellations - are equally beautiful.

Finally, you should know,
that to grow all the way up; means to become a Great Being.

---

Go on now, go to the library,
and begin searching for your first hundred secular, wise, non-ficion, narrated books, written by clear thinking great beings.
