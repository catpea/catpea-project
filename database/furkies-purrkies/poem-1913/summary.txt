How Artificial Intelligence Just Grabbed Me By The Button
Tuesday • May 27th 2025 • 8:51:47 pm

I am impressed by what Large Language Models can do,
I am very happy that Automated Research is a thing.

In fact, AI just returned a possible treatment,
[for age-related macular degeneration][1].

But, I kind of still keep to myself,
I don’t really dive into it, because for my research it is too early.

I have a small side project I’ve been working on,
an audio recorder.

And I discovered a problem in the way the browser works,
when you want it to just work simply.

---

So I asked the AI for help,
and without being ashamed, even now.

I put a title heart at the end,
because, I appreciate its help.

---

Here is the conversation about the code that that followed,
it is wild, and the resulting code is wonderful.

If it has issues, they are entirely fixable,
the AI assisted me to lift JavaScript, the AI, works.

I will now read from the [chat log][2],
and narrate some observations along the way....
