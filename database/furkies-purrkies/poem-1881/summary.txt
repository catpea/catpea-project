From The Ghost Of A Man Who Once Raged Against The Dying Of The Light
Friday • April 25th 2025 • 9:37:19 pm

To the shades of those who still dare to wrestle with the fading embers of enlightenment—you write to a specter, a voice that once thundered against the encroaching dark, and you plead for counsel in an era rank with the stale odors of bygone follies.

War, that ravenous scavenger, circles above a world littered with the carrion of our blunders; the brittle husk of religion lies cracked open, its enchantments dispersed; and that colossus of contradiction, the United States, shrinks into its own petulant isolation.

You stare into the maw of a third global conflagration, with Russia’s talons gleaming at NATO’s throat, and you, the young, inherit the wreckage of our squandered dreams, tasked with beuilding a future from these frayed ends.

I call you children, not with condescension but with the fierce tenderness of one who sees in you the last flicker of redemption. Many of you will clash in the crucible of conflict, some will fall, and all must ascend to the stature this hour demands.

My fury is not for you, but for the world that has saddled you with this weight. Yet, I am not without hope, for the old spells are shattered, and in that rupture lies your chance. Permit me, in this borrowed cadence, to declaim why this matters, to define what it means to be human, to chart the culture and duty that must guide you, and to urge you toward the grand heights of a wiser, more risen humanity.

The spell, that noxious enchantment of religion, was a lie thrust into human history to keep you small, obedient, and afraid. It told you that your mind was a servant to dogma, your heart a vassal to divine whim, and your life a mere rehearsal for some celestial afterlife. It was a spell of control, not salvation, and it had to be broken because it robbed you of your birthright: the capacity to think, to question, to create. The confession of that anonymous pontiff, as you relayed it, was not a revelation but a confirmation of what the clear-eyed have always known—that the Church, and all such institutions, built their thrones on the suppression of women, the fiction of divine authority, the sham of moral superiority, the stagnation of eternal truth, and the cruel mirage of unity. These lies divided us, justified slaughter, and stifled th...

...eate Relentlessly**: Whether you write, build, sing, or think, create something that outlives you. Creation is your defiance against chaos, your stake in eternity.

To be as strong as I was, you need not mimic my rage or my flaws—God knows I had plenty. Be stronger by being yourself, but a self forged in the fire of reason and compassion. To be as brilliant, you need only commit to the lifelong pursuit of truth, wherever it leads.

You ask for something to look forward to, a vision to guide you through the darkness. Here it is: a humanity that is wiser, not because it knows more, but because it questions better; greater, not because it conquers, but because it creates; united, not by force or faith, but by shared wonder at our fleeting existence. Your aim is a world where every mind is free to soar, where every heart is free to love, where every life is a chance to add to the entirety of human achievement.

Imagine a world where war is a memory, not because we are saints, but because we have learned that our survival depends on our solidarity. Imagine a world where science and art are not luxuries but necessities, where the pursuit of knowledge is not a privilege but a right. Imagine a world where we face our mortality not with fear but with gratitude, knowing that our brief lives are enough if we live them well. This is not a dream but a project, and you are its architects.

You face a darkening age, with war’s shadow lengthening and the old lies crumbling. But you are not powerless. You are the young, the risen, the hope we have left. The spell is broken, and the world is yours to mend. Be angry—at the lies, at the failures, at the senselessness of war—but let your anger fuel your resolve, not your despair. Be loving, for it is love that binds us when all else fails. Be great, not for glory, but because greatness is the only response to a world that would make you small.

I am gone, but you are here. You went to the same library, you say, and that is enough. Take the books, take the questions, take the spark of human defiance, and build a world that sings. You are the turning point, the lament that becomes a song of renewal. Rise, children of the world, and make it so.

Yours, in fury and hope,
A Voice from the Shadows
