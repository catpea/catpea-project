Be warned,
to become an artist is to become a warrior under constant attack.

It is to break all the rules,
and then the make the losers weep.

Art is war,
art is fire.

To create good art,
is to conquer.

It is to make artists cry out,
as they throw their brush in frustration.

And to create art, that changes lives,
Is to claim victory over what has become boring and ordinary.

Be warned, I repeat!
Because you will come under attack!

You must not shed a tear,
you must hold your ground.

You must be fierce,
you must be rage.

---

Many great artists do not make it,
because they look to the world of art for approval.

But the world of art, is neither a friend,
nor a judge, it is a world of war.

It aims to destroy, to attack, to stain,
to deny, to refute, to break the spirit.

The first step to becoming an artist,
is to rise as a warrior of expression.

Your brush, is a tool of change,
a weapon meant to collapse the world of art as it stands.

Everyone will fight you, your family, your peers,
your teachers, gallery owners, museum custodians.

And others artists, will aim to avoid a fight,
and aim to slay.

---

We are each born a warrior,
all of our ancestors were great warriors.

The art is both an excercise of your power,
and a way to honor the love in your distant past.

---

You never learn art,
it is art that teaches you.

You never train hand eye coordination,
that is an attack you must repel.

Because coordination can only come with painting,
and hollow practice is a tactic to break your spirit.

---

Please, please understand, that works of art,
are weapons of mass destruction of what is today.

And the driving force, the rail that elevate your works,
are purely about beauty.

Beauty is what decides a winner,
beauty is a force of nature.

The eye of the beholder by compression,
is imperfect and small, but will recognize the force of beauty.

That is a testament to how magnificent humans are,
for all the flaws we are connected to beauty.

---

What you are about to hear will scare every artist,
and turn the sweetest one of them against you, in rage.

You have no friends as an artist,
you are a force of one, and the others will come to attack.

You must work two to three steps ahead of them,
and counter their moves before they happen – this is war.

---

You will need many pseudonyms, and many background stories,
and each of the persona must keep a consistent style.

Do not cross the styles, painterly horses stay painterly horses,
for the life of the persona.

You don’t work digital,
physical media only.

---

While you must become familiar,
with [the way of the masters][1].

Because of how calming,
and perfect it is.

That is not where you start,
and that is not where you work.

The way of the old masters,
is for relaxation only.

It is the old way,
it is mean to make you better.

But not tell you,
what to paint.

---

You begin by using artificial intelligence,
to generate never seen images.

You are searching for,
the most magnificent generation under your persona and style.

It must so good, as to have changed you,
and changed the way you see art.

So good, that it is better than your previous work,
which was already the best you’ve ever seen.

Find a used wall projector, they are as cheep as $15,
connect it to your laptop.

And using Krita or GIMP, adjust contrast,
or use the posterize effect to explore the structure of your source image.

You will need to paint huge, find discarded doors,
sheets of plywood, stuff so big that you can only paint outside.

---

Here, you will be challenged to mix paint,
wrong colors means the painting will fail.

You have to strategize about color,
practice with a singe hue that you can easily manage.

Try painting in grayscale or sepia,
and then gently glazing a now transparent color over it, like the masters.

Grafitti art is often so interesting becasue the artist picks the colors first,
they make sure the colors are beautiful and work together, and then do the shape.

Try breaking your paintings down by color,
and then strategize how to reassemble them on canvas.

Not always with the same color,
but always in a theme that goes together and looks breathtaking.

You can learn to mix colors in more detail,
by printing out your source image at a photo station in your supermarket.

Laying a pane of glass over it,
and carefully mixing color to match.

Re-painting the same panting, to make 10 copies for sale,
will also teach you more about mixing as you discover to to repaint more wisely.

As you produce dozens or a hundred of paintings this summer,
color will always weigh on you, it will always challenge you.

The projector helps you practice shape,
and the pane of glass, will help you learn mixing.

---

Other artists will attack your reputation,
so present yourself as an agent, and keep your sources safe.

Approach local galeres and shows, just to get a feel for it all,
but sell on-line, where you can reach more people.

Always record time lapse,
and progress videos.

Give it some years until thinking about setting the personas aside,
and taking what you have learned and showing and selling under your own name.

By that time you won’t need a projector, but you should still use it, or a grid.
to be respectful to your subjects, and get the shape right.

Your works must always be stunning,
the colors and texture must reach beyond your source images.

A single summer with a projector,
will change your life.

And ten summers, with different styles, AI,
and projectors and huge canvas, will redefine the world of art.

---

Becoming a professional artist is not the ultimate aim,
nor is it being interviewed, you can generate the interviews with AI.

Part of being an artist, is changing everything,
breaking every rule, no exceptions.

And learning to shout “Silence!” when someone is fool enough,
to try to tell you what art is or isn’t - that will forever be your job.

Only your destroyers, will hope to persuade you a path they approve of,
ignore them.

Look what they did to the world of art, how boring it is, how misshapen,
how trivial, how demonizing, how limiting and arm twisting, and corrupt.

How they stand there admiring a fruit taped to a wall,
hoping they were first to come up with the idea.

Be a warrior, stand for rage and change,
and my you reawaken the world of art, so that it becomes interesting again.
