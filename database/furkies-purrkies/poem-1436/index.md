Learn JavaScript,
it is by far the most flexible and popular language.

And start using a lager more visual program,
that relies on JavaScript for scripting.

This way you can create programs visually,
and then customize what you need with he help of AI.

Node-RED is a visual programming environment,
that is both built with JavaScript and uses it for tweaks and scripts.

JavaScript is not Java,
it is just some broken business idea from ages ago.

People used to ridicule JavaScript,
but today it runs on server, desktops, phones, and powers the web.

All the websites use it in the browser,
and many websites will use it on the server too.

It just makes sense to write server stuff,
in the same language that the browser stuff is written in.

JavaScript belongs to the [C family][1] of programing languages,
sharing syntax with C, C++, PHP. Go, Dart, Rust, and Zig, along with C#, Java, and Swift.

You won't feel at home with those languages,
as each has unique ways of doing things, but they won't feel alien.

To Quote the world encyclopedia:

"[C Family] languages are likely to share some syntax and basic language constructs with C, such as semicolon-terminated statements, curly-brace-delimited code blocks, parentheses-delimited parameters, and infix-notated arithmetical and logical expressions. The use of curly brackets ({}) to denote blocks of code has led to the name curly-bracket languages being sometimes used".

---

I recommend you make your way towards the server environment,
once you feel comfortable with JavaScript.

The server environment is handled via a program called nodejs,
it is just JavaScript pulled out of the browser and made to run on the command line.

There you can make enormous applications, build things like browser pluggins,
and run small side project experiments.

---

But before you get there,
slow down, and [master Node-RED][2].

It is not a babysitting application,
visual programming is the future.

By mastering Node-RED,
and having your first taste of JavaScript there.

You will also discover your first powerful business idea,
and a promise of a monthly subscription business.

To put it shortly, learn Node-RED,
and then program a Node-RED clone...

Aimed at some specific problem that people have,
and you can help them solve via visual programming and your library of nodes.

---

Lastly, if you ever get stuck, first check for videos on the internet,
then see if you can find a tutorial about it, and finally ask the AI.

Begin you quest today, by using the magical word tutorial,
search for "[Node-RED tutorial][3]", and then once you get into it "[JavaScript Tutorial][4]"

It will get easier, and sooner than later, because in the world of programming,
each new thing you learn enhances all your other abilities.
