JS-DQD; Or, God Mode Interestato Potato?
Monday • August 11th 2025 • 5:47:21 pm

Let me get you started, on the highest of heights,
I call it the Delta-Q-Delta, or GOD MODE.

---

Bootstrap, a GUI project that helps with building website interfaces,
uses wisdom, to proceed, they are slow, but move towards correct aims.

The main developer had a long-standiong wish to add an [Offcanvas Sidebar][0],
Offcanvas means, it exists, but beyond the visible screen.

It is not on the GUI canvas,
it is in the minus space.

---

Because they have much to worry about,
and legacy ideas to support, they still have jQuery bits.

They are too far behind for technologies like Web Components,
which help you create custom HTML elements, like span or div, but bigger.

Because Offcanvas is the latest feature they added,
I will be using it here in the example.

I went to the spot at github where Bootstrap has their JavaScript,
I copies the url of the 300 line Offcanvas JavaScript file.

I pasted the [offcanvas url][1] into a recent AI:
you can use github AI.

And I asked: “Could you give me a bullet point breakdown of what features they strive to cover”.

Make sure that it talks about the code, not user unterface. For me it responded with “1 Declarative Show/Hide, 2 Accessibility, 3 Backdrop Management, 4 Scroll and Body Management, 5 Event Lifecycle and Custom Events, 6 Data API and Declarative Markup, 7 Animation and Transitions, 8 Multi-instance Safety, 9 Responsiveness, 10 Dismiss Triggers, 11 jQuery Support, 12 Modular, Extensible Architecture”

[It also explained what those things do in a paragraph or two][5],
You can always add “Explain it to someone who is new to programming”

And the AI will take care of you more than any teacher ever could,
or will.

Any confusion here, is a problem with the way schools work,
it is not a problem with you, or your mind.

You were simply receiving fake education,
so that the teachers could get paid.

Think of it as a church of pretending to teach,
and of pretending to learn by desperate cramming or memorization.

But please become aware of the fact,
that your teachers and sometimes parents, tricked you into inventing memorization and cramming.

DQD, they are messing with your life, with your mind and future,
use AI to learn programming or they may ruin your life.

You also have to fight the dragon...

...zilla Developer Network.

And then using the 3 Web Components Guides “Using custom elements”, “Using shadow DOM”, “Using templates and slots”.

I am sure you don’t have to do this, but I scrolled down on each page, and copied the “View this page on GitHub” URL.

And in deed it took a moment,
before returning a [beautiful response that I attach][2].

Take a look at Event Life Cycle in #5,
look how simple things are under the hood.

How easy to master,
how easy to go full DQD.

#7 shows animations are in CSS, not JavaScript,
it is not too hard to learn, AI will do it for you.

This is just for specifying object attributes,
and objects are HTML elements.

And #8 Multi-instance Safety, is just about closing,
other instances of the off-canvas panels before showing this one.

---

What is so special about this response is that every item,
shows an OffCanvas Web Component.

But only featuring the stuff in the item,
I am so jealous.

And that the computer talks to you,
oh my goodness…

I can already imagine someone yelling at their High School teacher,
“either be as effective as my AI or zip it Ms. Shmeasles”

You have to be careful whey they do bring AI into schools,
because they will still try to teach you the old curriculum.

The crap that gets you nothing,
you must always aim to learn things as effective as programming.

They maybe able to take the teacher out of the standardized crap,
but they can’t take the crap out of standardization.

---

Finally, in part because Halloween is so close,
I will now scare you and most of the world with some amazing JavaScript code.

I asked the best programming AI,
to translate five of the most magical things from Prolog to ES2025 JavaScript (latest version of javascript)

I hope you have access to the original text version
of this strange recording.

And if you do, oh, my, goodness,
grab onto your butt before clicking the [prolog link][4].
