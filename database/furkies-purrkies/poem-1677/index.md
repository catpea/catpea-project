Sets and reps are a popular activity at the gym,
people are taught to do 3 to 6 set of 10 to 15 reps.

Meaning, lift a pretty heavy weight 10 to 15 times,
rest, and repeat the process 3 to 6 times.

Everyone swears by this because everyone sees initial results,
the body will adapt to the heavy, and in deed grow muscle.

However, few people know, the speed with which our bodies adapt,
sets and reps are very slow to grow muscle.

---

To use dumbbells for example,
a heavy weight is usually around 20 to 30 pounds.

After a long time, however, the body will stop adapting,
and do nothing to allow for adding more weight.

Here people try less rest, a couple of lifts of heavy,
but all of this is hard and results are discouraging for most.

Those who live the gym lifestyle do continue adapting,
but at a much slower rate, nothing like what it was initially.

The simple explanation for this, is that they aren’t able
to add as much weight as they initially did.

Originally, in a short time they went up to 20 or 30 pound dumbbells,
now they can’t do that again.

They can’t just leap,
into lifting 40 or 60 pound dumbbells.

The reason for that is,
our bodies don’t pay attention to numbers.

Sets, reps and rest, turn 20 or 30 pounds into an introductory exercise,
the weight is too heavy, the rest is too long, not enough sets, not enough reps.

And it is not possible to add more, as the weight is already too heavy,
this is called a plateau.

You will need dance trance,
and trailmix with protein powder.

Because you are moving towards an endurance based workout,
from the slow going and restful sets and reps.

You enter a trance all the time when thinking about interesting things,
or driving back home.

To do it at the gym you simply synchronize your motion and lifts,
with the beats of fresh songs, consider 1990 eurodance.

Though start with your favorite slow songs before you get there,
at first you have to train your body to lift for an hour nos stop.

And you do that the same way joggers do it,
by resting less and less, over a stretch of just about 10 weeks.

That is why you should start with 3 or 5 pounds,
because developing the duration is more important than the weight you are lifting.

If you are large, I recommend walking the Appalachian Trail,
to prepare your body for two hour non stop workouts.

Either way, hiker food is what you need to rely on for energy,
in your endurance workouts.

You need hard to digest carbohydrates in your system,
all the time, when working out and when sleeping.

You will be gaining weight,
though a lot of it will be muscle.

Which brings us to the upgrade of your sets and reps,
instead of stopping after you do you set of heavy weights.

Go to the 3 or 5 pound dumbbells, and lift them for long enough,
to be able to do your heavy excessive again.

You may need to go down by 5 or 10 pounds,
to be able to fuse the two, heavy and high volume.

On your off days, do just high volume,
you should work ut 5 to 7 days a week.

But you can do sets and reps every other day,
you will develop much faster now.

And continuing to lift heavy will give you an edge,
over just the high volume workouts.

But remember there is no stopping to rest,
you now lift 3 or 5 pound dumbbells instead, and may not sit during that.

Please do not ignore the dance trance, you will fail without it,
make sure to eat enough trailmix, and soak it in initially hot water overnight.

This will protect you dental work,
and make trail-minx easier on your stomach.

Every Friday, test if you can do your high volume exercise,
with 2.5 pounds extra per hand.

If so, don’t jump into it, take a couple of months,
to actually move up higher, let your body catch up and rest during the delay.

---

In summary, instead of resting around and during sets and reps,
begin lifting 3 or 5 pounds, fill the rest gaps with light dumbbells.

You will see weekly results,
surpassing even your initial gains from when you just started working out.
