The Dallas Pitch
Friday • September 19th 2025 • 5:48:43 pm

The conference room smelled of bourbon and leather, that particular combination that meant serious money was about to change hands. Waylon Pritchard III adjusted his bolo tie—pure silver with a scorpion trapped in amber—and smiled at the three men across the mahogany table. His smile never reached his eyes. In Dallas, that was considered a business asset.

"Gentlemen," Waylon began, his drawl thick as crude oil, "I'm gonna tell you how to own this nation for the next hundred years. Not rent it, not lease it—*own* it, deed and title."

He clicked a remote. The screen behind him illuminated with test scores, graduation rates, literacy statistics—all trending downward since 1983. Then another slide: teacher suicide rates up 340% since 2001. Student anxiety disorders up 500%. Military recruitment from bottom-quartile schools up 780%.

"Y'all ever wonder why a British knight named Ken Robinson got himself so worked up about American schools? Man spent his whole career screaming into the void about creativity dying in classrooms. Poor beautiful thought it was an accident." Waylon chuckled, a sound like gravel in a disposal. "Accident. Lord have mercy."

He pulled up a photograph. "This was Dr. ******** District, 2018. Had a program that took dropout rates from 40% to 3% in two years. Know where she is now? Psychiatric ward. We had one of my girls, Isabella, work her for fourteen months. Started as a teaching assistant, built trust, got invited to family barbecues. Then came the photos at the hotel, the planted cocaine in her car, the edited videos suggesting inappropriate relationships with students. All fabricated, but try explaining deepfakes to a school board in Texas."

The younger man shifted uncomfortably.

"Or this one," Waylon continued, clicking through slides. "Jonathan *****, tried to implement Finnish-style education in Detroit. My girl **** spent three years as his research assistant. We documented every coffee they shared, every late night working on proposals. When he was about to present to the Department of Education, **** claimed assault. No evidence needed—just the accusation during the MeToo era. His wife left him, took the kids. He ate a bullet last Christmas. Left a note saying he couldn't understand how his life's work became no...

...because rebellion requires imagination. Where no one questions because questioning requires curiosity. Where no one loves because love requires the capacity to recognize another soul. It is a world so perfectly broken that it doesn't even know it's broken.

Even Hell has hope, Jimmy. The damned know they're damned. They remember what they lost. They can dream of redemption, even if it never comes. But Waylon's world? It is a Hell that doesn't know it's Hell, populated by the damned who don't know they're damned, ruled by devils who don't know they're devils.

And in that world, Jimmy, you and your kind will be kings of nothing, rulers of automatons, wealthy in currencies that buy only emptiness. You'll have your wars, but they'll be fought by humans so hollow the term barely applies. You'll have your power, but over subjects incapable of recognizing subjugation.

Is that what you want, Jimmy? To be a shepherd of sheep who don't know they're sheep, who don't even know what wolves are, who have forgotten that fields exist beyond the slaughter house?

Be careful what you wish for, Jimmy. Be very, very careful.

For when the machine Waylon builds finally stops—and all machines eventually stop—what remains won't be humanity. It will be something else, something that can't rebuild because it doesn't remember there was ever anything to build. A species that can't rise because it has forgotten it fell. A darkness so complete that it has forgotten light ever existed.

And at the end, when the last human-shaped thing stops pretending to think, when the final flicker of consciousness admits defeat, when even Waylon's precision breaks down in the face of absolute entropy—he will weep. Yes, even Waylon will weep. Not from sorrow, not from regret, but from the simple mechanical recognition that there's nothing left to destroy.

That is your legacy, Jimmy. That is what you're purchasing with your bourbon toasts and your handshake deals.

From my throne of flames, I offer you this one gift—the gift I offer all species foolish enough to end themselves: Knowledge. Know what you're doing. Know what you're becoming. Know what you're ending.

And know that even the devil himself looks upon your work with disgust.

Sleep well, Jimmy. Dream while you still can. Jimmy.
