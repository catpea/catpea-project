When I originally tested my tail,
I used a normal belt and just let it dangle behind me.

I think of this as a symbolic way,
of having a tail, as the tail is not really attached to you.

---

Mark I, my first attempt at attaching my tail,
is still the most powerful and reliable.

You use a small backpack,
designed for water bladders.

Empty the backpack,
and shove a meter long carpenter's aluminum ruler up there.

You may need to make a little hole,
in the bottom of the back pack.

And you can give the part of the ruler,
that is in the back pack ribs.

So that,
it does not move sideways.

I threaded my ruler,
through the side wall of a hamper basket.

And that worked,
perfectly.

---

If you fight crime daily,
you will find that your aluminum ruler will work harden and snap off.

After about a couple of months, or sooner,
upgrade to a steel bar if that happens, they are not too heavy.

The backpack mount approach,
is extremely sturdy.

The only real flaw is that, if you fight crime in a leotard,
or worst yet, without one...

The backpack gets really scratchy,
and after a couple of weeks, it become as annoying as the bad guys.

---

Which brings us to Mark II, a much lighter design,
that instead of a small backpack.

Relies on a weightlifting belt only,
expect best results, from belts that have vertical plastic ribs in the back.

Use a soldering iron, to punch holes in the plastic,
and consider zip ties, and a cheap vertical paper tower holder made of wire.

Just attach it to the back of the belt with zip ties,
and you will have a mounting point for your tail.

There are two problems here,
the weightlifting belt brings your tail up a tiny bit too high.

You have to be careful to mount the tail assembly
as low as you can.

You can't just mount it,
to the middle of the back of the weight lifting belt.

As that is quite unfortunately,
just too high above the tail bone.

And the second problem is for the intense crime fighters,
because even the most plastic-net-like of the belts.

Will absorb moisture,
and it will get hot, after just a couple of hours.

---

Which brings us to Mark III,
a steel wire based design.

Basically a steel wire is organically bent,
around your waist, with a nice v shape towards your backbone.

From bottom of which you add another wire,
where the tail will go.

You must purchase a very soft wire,
for experimenting with the shape first.

The final shape is shockingly organic,
and nothing like a belt.

It absolute look like a tail assembly,
and fits the tail right over your tailbone.

And because it is based on a steel wire,
there is nothing here to absorb moisture.

It is easy to keep clean,
jut wipe it down after a crime fighting session.

And it is field adjustable,
the system can be made to fit you perfectly.

You don't need the wire to wrap,
all the way around you.

Just enough to go around hips and work with the v shape in the back
to stabilize the tail.

Use pliers to round all the pointy ends into loops,
and then some elastic string in the front.

Make sure you don't have any pointy ends,
and if you can buy enough wire for three versions.

Mark III works so well,
you can set it up perfectly.

----

All three designs are good,
they are sturdy and reliable.

I suggest you make all three,
this way you'll have a backup if something breaks.

---

In my research,
after the initial work hardening of tail.

I have discovered,
a really nice rule.

Keep it light weight,
always buy the lightest materials you can find.

The lighter your tail,
the less likely the chance it will snap off.
