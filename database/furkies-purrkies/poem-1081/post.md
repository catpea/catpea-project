If a school tricks you out of programming,
then even though you maybe great with computers…

You will never really be able to use them,
it is like a school tricking you out of learning how to write.

Becoming a programmer is not about working in an office cubicle,
it is about not needing to.

---

And today with the rise of these $10M language models, or AI, as we can call it,
you can request bits of code from the machine.

It is exactly like pair programming,
a computer program will be not-so-clumsily helping you create your programs.

---

In the beginning, you face the problem that I am so familiar with, it is sad,
I used to call it the foot in the door problem.

But I refer to it as,
finding pleasant on-ramps, now.

Basically it means you develop a desire to have a need for a specific program,
or technology, to put your foot in the door, and start learning it with an aim in mind.

---

Here you can see how different that is from what goes on in school,
you don’t get on-ramps in school.

You get  textbooks that have been flattened out,
into an easy to test surface.

And it is a dangerous way to try to learn something,
because they are not meant for learning but memorization and pretending.

Schools above all are interested in retaining accreditation,
they created a system for you to pass state requirements and entry exams.

But that is not real education,
that is just tricking you into having an impression of one.

This is how people can take a programming class,
and not know how to program, or maybe even learn o hate programming.

Imagine writing being taught so bad,
that kids would say they hate it, and just never learn how to write.

---

Again programming is a fundamental talent,
like language, or writing, and ineffective education in this area is a crime.

---

You have to start on your own, and I recommend JavaScript,
as it is the most capable language with the strongest momentum forward.

And you won’t feel like a clown, when you put your software on the server,
and still have to learn JavaScript to give it a User Interface.

Node.js and similar bring JavaScript to the server,
and that basically seals the deal.

It is the language you will need to use,
in the most critical moments.

And if you ever care to dive into the Linux Kernel,
or writing your own drivers, the syntax change will feel good.

Brackets that you are most familiar with,
will hold it all together for you.

---

But you should focus on fighting your poverty,
before you get to developing open source projects and fun gadgets.

Look what is happening on the internet,
people come up with amazing ideas like AI, and setup websites with a monthly membership.

This should be your ultimate destination,
crafting self provisioning networks that expand and contract as needed.

And helping all your sign-ups to become happy,
they are happiest when they are creating products.

And that is what Generative AI does,
just a simple website that helps your users manage their products is a neat start.

A good onramp, you don’t have to connect to an artificial intelligence,
you can pre-create accounts with 10, 100, or 1,000 beautiful unique images.

People don’t’ want to learn prompting AI,
they just want to setup their stores, and pay for some traffic to get the sales going.


You can let them choose what image packs they start with,
and let them pick bundles along he way.

While your website helps them track all their efforts,
and todo lists, of launching products on various platforms.

Basically, they get a planner, and start converting those images in to products,
wherever an image can be applied to some physical thing, t-shirt, cup blanket.

---

AI creates products out of thin air,
and since old designs get boring, there will always be market for more.

And yes you can run AI on a gaming rig,
you can use Stable Diffusion with some extras to make beautiful images.

It is a very broad but a quality idea, project management,
and cool product-image bundles, or access to a image generator by using some distant API.

---

Don’t delay, start learning programming,
don’t let schools cut you off from your future, just so that school staff gets paid.

The path less traveled is not graduating from ineffective schools,
but taking your education in your own hands.

Where no one will force you into debt,
or cubicles, or TPS reports, and writing unit tests.

---

Become an independent inventor,
self educate by turning easy on-ramp-finding into an art form.

And may your software empires rise faster,
that you can wrap your head around it all.

Remember that Human Beings are meant to grow all the way up,
there is no stopping half way through life and calling it enough, and having a crisis.

Our entire world needs to start transcending their cubicles,
and growing up all the way up, until everyone, stands, as a great being.
