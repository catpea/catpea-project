Learning For Real
Saturday • May 22nd 2021 • 9:10:20 pm

Life, in large part is about becoming a noble, dignified, and thus great being;

and later, helping the world grow.

I am sure someone, someday will simply explain,

why so many things have gone wrong today.

It could be that nobody is really in charge,

and the liars are keeping everything in a constant state of destruction.

It could be because of lack of education,

and the thing that is disrupting education is the ongoing-uneducation, and fantasy beliefs and lifestyles.

Be it believing a falsehood, or pretending to know something,

or having been mislead, it will all have lasting consequences as those things influence our decisions.

It isn't always easy to pull our selves up and above,

am I wrong to say; that finding a good book or a good friend; is... kind of a function of luck?

The unlucky, may never set themselves free,

they may never come across something that is compatible with their mind; that will influence them to keep learning and rising.

Obviously, schools were meant to fix this,

they were meant to teach us what is false, what is wrong, what isn't real, how parents shouldn't behave.

And school - really - should be our Shield and a Place of Wisdom,

but it is actually a place of punishment, that frequently will cause parents to punish the student further.

This is an example of an interruption to growing up,

our natural curiosity would have us do amazing things.

Observing [Jupiter's Moons, and Saturn's Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei),

through our own telescope, and that would be just one tiny step away from [taking pictures of the Andromeda Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXcRKoxTPVg).

We would be [Composing Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU),

it is unbelievably easy to compose beautiful melodies for the piano with a Digital Audio Workstation like the Open Source [lmms](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lmms).

The world of Art would open it self to us as we put our photographs through basic [GIMP photo filters](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=GIMP+filters+tutorial),

and [project outlines of our art inspirations on walls or canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1fAWGTTFdY).

Then our attention would turn to fixing Climate, fixing Politics...

...ly.

Move beyond, who is right and wrong, \_do not\_ waste time on broken things,

begin your self education, immediately; and help your classmates if you can.

As to your financial worries, try to learn computers, programming and design,

and build a [series of little companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM) until you get the hang of things.

Start slow, be gentle, you have much to learn, here are a few Authors and real Teachers to get you started,

there are thousands of these magnificent individuals, and you will have to understand most of their thoughts and philosophy in order get a real, self balancing, and mutually reinforcing picture of the world.
