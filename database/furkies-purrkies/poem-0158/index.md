Before we learn what we should know,

we must first learn how to grow.

---

To break out of all the rooms and halls,

we must destroy all the invisible walls.

As we cannot reason-about what we canâ€™t see,

and so we must surpass our limits before we can think free.

---

It is not so much moving forward,

as it is always growing upward.

We say forward when we seem to stop,

but we mean up - up to the top.

And then rise above where our limits once stood,

from could to would, to finally should.

---

What once we saw as highest complexity,

we will know to navigate like a small city.

Then, we can help people finish their thoughts,

help them to their stars, connect their dots.

---

We must learn, it is just how Human Beings are,

we have to see the whole before we can find the star.
