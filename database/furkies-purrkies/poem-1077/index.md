Real talent is not a gift one is born with,
it is forged like the works of a blacksmith.

It is the opposite of useless memorization in school,
here, each of your talents is a useful tool.

Do not allow fake education to displace your talents,
as that will push your entire existence off balance.

That education does not focus on enabling you more,
is a sign that teacher won't help you soar.

---

Your talents must __always__ come first,
and each one of them must be well rehearsed.

Practice what moves you often,
so that your abilities never soften.

And pursuits of curiosities should be part of your plan,
search for new talents as often as you can.

Talents create a constellation within you,
and no day must pass without learning something new.

---

When you finally sit down to create,
your talents will ensure it will all work out great.

Talents re-assemble to create the tools you need,
and they help you build with immense speed.

Talent for programming is great for automation,
it is well worth the initial frustration.

But writing, painting, and composition, are critical too,
it is certainly something your elder self wished they knew.

---

No matter what you are told, the only way to break out of the mold,
is to learn, rise and broaden your view of the world.

Learn to stand up against fake education and crooks,
and search for talent and wisdom in thousands of wise books.

Talents will combine to help you build your ways,
they are the starlight that will always add to your days.
