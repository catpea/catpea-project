I asked AI who our bestest best friends wore,
and this iss the poem it produced.

---

Socrates, with his cup of hemlock,
Questioned all, our thoughts to unlock.

"Know thyself," he urged with ease,
In clear thinking, our true greatness and peace.

Epicurus, in his garden's shade,
Shared wisdom, fear of gods to evade.

Pleasure's not in gold or wine,
True joy in virtue, friends, and mind align.

Lucretius, poet of the ancient time,
Sang atoms' dance, in verse sublime.

No gods to fear, nor fate to dread,
Reason guides us, when all's said.

Carvaka, of ancient land,
Dared to question, free from hand,

Of scripture's grip, a breath of air,
Human life, our truest care.

Michael Servetus, spark of reason's flame,
Braved the fires, challenged the old claim.

In blood and ink, his quest for truth,
Inscribed the path for minds to sooth.

Giordano Bruno, the daring cosmic seer
Whispered secrets of spheres so dear.

"The universe is vast," he said,
"And in our minds, great truths are spread."

Baruch Spinoza, lens grinder, mind refined
Mapped the cosmos, the divine redefined.

"Freedom's the essence," he did declare,
In understanding, our true welfare.

Thomas Hobbes, in Leviathan's mighty tome,
Sought order in the human home.

"Life is nasty, brutish, and short",
Yet, a social contract to support.

John Locke, with wisdom clear and bright,
Championed natural rights, insight.

"Life, liberty, and property,"
Are sacred, in our sovereignty.

Voltaire, the witty, bold, and bright,
Fought for freedom, stood for right.

"I disapprove of what you say,"
"But I will defend to the death your right to say it,"
he'd say without fright.

Mary Wollstonecraft, voice for women's right,
In "Vindication of the Rights of Woman," shone the light.

"Reason itself, demands equality,"
For all mankind, her clarion call for liberty.

Charles Darwin, with his voyage's tale,
Unveiled life's secrets, didn't fail.

"Survival of the fittest," he revealed,
Nature's truth, unsealed.

Bertrand Russell, logic's luminary knight,
In Principia, logic's light.

For peace and reason, he stood tall,
An ethicist, a pacifist, above all.

Ayn Rand Rand, in the valley of Galt, declared,
"I swear by my life, and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."

Individualism's torchbearer, she was clear,
In rational self-interest, her philosophy did appear.
