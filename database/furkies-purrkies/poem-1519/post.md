A writers block just means you haven’t yet walked,
the Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide trails…

While listening to narrated books created by Great Beings,
Philosophers, Thinkers, Crud Kicking Troublemakers and World’s True Leaders.

---

Ladies and Germtermen, some of our greatest thinkers,
are belittled, ridiculed, and pushed into chaos, sometimes worse.

Real meaningful, integrated, authentic, noble & magnificent education,
is hard to come by, if not downright impossible to find.

In the frenzy to profit from AI, worlds largest companies exposed,
how little respect they have for humanity…

By revealing how much 3effort goes into shaping what you see,
and how the resulting products are skewed.

Trusting any institution to deliver real education,
especially one that charges a lot of money and does not share all lectures…

Is dumb, everyone else is lying to you,
so your shool is doing it too.

That is the root of the writers block,
lies, dishonesty, corruption, and manipulation.

---

Those are the very things you escape,
when you set off to travel the worlds greatest adventure trails.

I should stop this poem right here,
right now, because I have said all there is.

But I will paint you a picture,
of how creativity is a two way trail.

---

On one end you begin with a deliberate message,
this is where your fake education will shut you down.

But on the other end, you let chance drive you,
this method has been used every quack that has ever lived.

Not to say, that you will become a duck,
they did it for coin, you do it to share your wisdom, you are not a quack.

---

Let’s begin with something most of us have seen on TV,
Tarot Cards, Runes, and Weird Bones.

All of these are ways to interrogate one self,
sometimes for introspection, sometimes to merely sound smart.

Tarot readings use random cards,
to help the reader, have something smart to say, to the customer.

A philosopher, armed with such cards,
would give magnificent reading, a street hustler… not so much.

---

These methods hope to ignite an idea in you,
by association, imagination, memories.

And in fact, today, you can use image generating AI,
for the same purpose.

You only need to look at the showcase,
and if you do like something, you can regenerate your own version.

You can even use it along your story,
as illustrations.

---

But there is more to it, you can also let the random,
build the sequence of events in your book.

Not everything in your books,
must be connected to everything else.

Look no further than Indiana Jones,
moving between multiple places in the world.

What a breath of fresh air,
is to experience an adventure within an adventure.

---

And if you do walk the trails,
with narrated books playing in your ears.

The moment you write down a little thought or widom,
on an index card…

You begin building,
something magnitude greater than tarot.

But, please, aim not to keep your cards in any order,
shuffle them, and keep them simple.

And between adventures and the wisdom you keep,
you will never be lost for words again.
