Before we trust school with our knowledge,

and our path to wisdom and beyond.

Before we assume that College.

will open gateways to a job we love.

Before we trust somebody, or something else,

we must begin learning on our own, and never stop.

One of the first things we must do as a self aware human being,

is accept the responsibility for our own education.

All the other educational things,

must become a secondary concern.

---

Furthermore,

we cannot blindly trust our employers.

They do not exist to help us,

but for their own profit.

We have to learn to become a business person,

so that we do not entirely rely on others.

Losing a job must not translate to,

becoming homeless.

---

I do not know for sure, but we maybe seeing that schools do as little as possible,

and employers pay as little as they can get away with.

One does it for funding,

and the other for profit maximization.

---

On the other hand, self education, and readiness to support oneself

by launching a smart and small independent business are, wise ideas.

---

Don't worry, it all takes many many years,

it is part of our growing up.

Learning slowly at a pace that fits us best,

as we adventure from one curiosity to another, in a sequence reflecting what we already know.

And slowly considering dozens of ever improving business ideas,

by dreaming them up from our teenage days on, is very empowering, if not down right stress relieving.

---

And self education revolves around adventure and narrated books,

adventure can mean traveling old or great cities, or nature parks, or city libraries and local museums.

It is extremely healthy,

and there is no stress involved.

Plus, being curious about launching a business, or just being mindful of it,

will call our attention to books about entrepreneurs business strategies, over the course of the years.

Self education and entrepreneurship, is in no way trouble or a burden,

it is just another friendly talent we learn as we grow - it is good for us.
