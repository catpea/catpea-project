Programming is your friend,
it will help you conduct a thinking machine orchestra.

---

In this text I gently explain,
that often programs are already stressed.

They can’t do what you need them to do,
instead you have to build a miniature alternative.

And then use the system that can’t help you,
as a canvas, and your miniature, as a brush.

---

Artificial Intelligence gives you the power of a thousand suns,
but you have to use it in just the right way.

I’ve been looking to address an old and messy problem,
with JavaScript package management.

And it can’t be fixed, if you try you will fail,
though you could get something operational it wouldn't last a decade.

---

A software package, is a triumph, that has been sold and sent away,
it is no longer part of a developer madness, it is a closed off loop.

You can’t use a system crafted for publishing,
for your own development purposes.

All you can do,
is leave it untouched.

And whatever packages depend on one another,
have to depend on their published versions.

Not your development version,
your development and their publishing must not touch.

---

You don’t have to know all these rules,
you just have to be delicate.

And escape your desire,
to make a thing into something that it is not.

---

You go back to the beginning,
and you find another way.

And if you fail again,
you restart again.

That is how science is done,
failure is learning, failure is data.

Unlike Success,
failure is a path to mastery.

---

If you already failed multiple times,
look how much more you know, than the people who are just starting out.

You may pause, but you can’t quit,
you already have good wisdom.

And if you quit,
the world will become darker for it.

---

The reason why I chose the word delicate,
is because though it is a broad field.

It is a network, of delicate little pathways,
that are yet to take you to greater possibilities.

---

Another problem I recently faced, is theme customization,
the framework I was using, went crazy.

They have so many variables for color,
that it is not usable, not if you are a rational person.

But again, it is publishable to,
you can create an alternative color theory, compatible with theirs.

And with just the movement of a few sliders,
and some clicks, translate the simple into the mess they have created.

---

Programming will give you a love chomp, and a kick in the gonads,
unless you stop twisting things that aren’t into what you want them to be.

---

I will close with an Art example, the reason you are bad at watercolors,
is because you are disrespecting the color.

Long, long before you purchase your paints,
you learn to use a projector for sketching.

And then, watercolor, with tea and coffee,
until you understand earn each color, one by one.

---

Be more delicate with code, take smaller steps,
and wait until your curiosity takes you back to learn some more.

If nothing calls to you,
the find an old abandoned pixer art game.

And bring the characters to life with artificial intelligence,
so that you can watch them build out their own world, their way inside out.
