# Finding The Daughters Of Eve

**2025 had only 36 days left,**
**Ms. Tarter said this was supposed to be the big year, if all calculations were correct.**

---

She was 16 years old, barely hanging on,
devastated by Standardized Education and Fake Adults.
She felt, all she had left in her,
was one final question: "Where are the daughters of Eve?"

She was going to unwind the Milky Way,
to find the other solar systems,
that coalesced,
during Coatlicue's collapse.

Her mission, to increase the probability,
of SETI finding a signal.
Her only break,
is that they would have similar chemical signature.

---

School and adults,
were suffocating.
Parading their failures,
like some achievement.
Showing their greatness,
by dressing up their failures.
Culture was moving backwards,
she was headed the other direction.

*The Computer Lab, First Simulations*

*The billion progenitor stars*
*that lived and died before the sun was born*
*wept in their remnants,*
*scattered their grief across the interstellar medium,*
*and waited.*

*They waited in silicon carbide crystals,*
*in nanodiamonds carrying xenon signatures,*
*in graphite spherules with extinct titanium-44,*
*for someone to read the message*
*they wrote in isotopes.*

*Four and a half billion years,*
*they waited for her.*

She sat in the back of the computer lab, last row, last machine, the one with the flickering monitor that nobody wanted. The teacher was explaining how to make a pie chart in spreadsheet software. This was Information Technology. This was the future they were preparing her for.

On her screen, hidden behind a minimized window, an SVG canvas held three thousand points of light. Each one a star. Each one positioned according to right ascension and declination from the Gaia DR3 catalog. She had parsed the data herself, written the JavaScript herself, plotted the galactic coordinates herself.

The teacher saw her screen.

"That's not the assignment."

"I know. I'm modeling stellar kinematics. I'm trying to reverse the trajectories of solar-type stars to find—"

"I don't care what you're trying to do. The assignment is pie charts."

"But I already know how to make pie charts. I've known since I was 9. I'm trying to find the Sun's siblings. Stars that formed in the sa...

...eone *looking back*?

They would have said she was deflecting. They would have said she was avoiding accountability. They would have said she needed to focus on what matters.

As if pie charts matter. As if anything they were teaching her would still matter in a hundred years, in a thousand years, in the billion years the galaxy takes to rotate once.

---

She walked home in the November dark. Orion was rising in the east. She found Vega overhead, impossibly bright, and traced from there to the constellation Hercules—dim, hard to see in the light-polluted sky, but there. Somewhere in that patch of darkness, HD 162826 was shining. A star 15% more massive than the Sun. A sister who had drifted 110 light-years away over four and a half billion years of galactic rotation.

If you could run time backward—really backward, not just in simulation—you would see them converge. The Sun and HD 162826 and hundreds of others, drawing together, falling back into the natal cloud, unmixing from the galaxy's stellar population, collapsing back into the cold dense clump that Coatlicue's death had compressed.

She couldn't run time backward for real. But she could run it backward in code. She could find the others.

If they would just let her.

---

The tears came, and she let them.

Above her, the winter stars burned.

Below her, on the sidewalk, in the cracks, in the soil, in every handful of earth on this planet—presolar grains. Nanodiamonds forged in supernovae. Silicon carbide crystals condensed in the winds of red giants. Graphite spherules carrying the isotopic signatures of stars that died before the Sun was born.

The billion progenitor stars had sent their messages forward in time. Tiny crystals, drifting through the interstellar medium, incorporated into the molecular cloud, surviving the collapse, surviving the accretion disk, surviving the formation of planets, raining down on Earth for four and a half billion years.

*We were here,* the crystals said. *We lived and we died and we made the atoms in your bones.*

She wiped her eyes.

Tiny diamonds and silicon carbide crystals in her hair.

**36 days left.**

**She kept working.**

We are not alone.
