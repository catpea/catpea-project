Some say that there is no morality without commandments,
but that is a result of trickery, of being tricked out of wisdom.

Others say that humanity’s aim is enlightenment,
which tricks them into thinking that it can be reaches through multiple cultures.

Whereas in fact, a culture must abandon all its bad ideas,
and focus on expanding their best and wisest, which is a path to wisdom.

Wisdom is the core of Philosophy,
the meaning of the word Philo Sophia, is love of wisdom.

And you can see, already, how wisdom brings cultures together,
as they seek the same thing, thus making world peace a reality.

---

However, wisdom is just the beginning,
for one, philosophy is the mother of sciences.

Wisdom is as much about knowledge,
as it is about great ideas.

---

The next great leap forward,
the step that wisdom makes possible.

Is Authenticity, Virtue, and Dignity,
a rejection of dishonesty.

Best worded as intolerance of liars, manipulators, and cheaters,
these are dark hats, the witch doctors, the false leaders.

Rejection of which,
helps humanity grow in wisdom unrestricted.

Inauthentic leaders, cultivate war,
war is a crime, war crimes are prevented when wars are prevented.

And country’s inhabitants unless they are mislead,
do not want war.

The governments serve the people,
they are not meant to use people a their servants and soldiers.

War is such a failure,
that only those who want it should fight in it.

---

Poverty ends, use of the concept of money,
without elimination of poverty first, is unethical.

The way we use money today is incomplete,
a leaky abstraction at best.

---

And you bet there is a step above that,
a lot more personal one, truly creating a force of one.

And that is, growing all the way up,
until one becomes a Great Being.

---

Failure to grow all the way up,
again tricks a person into a lifetime of simple mistakes.

And rarely,
equally simple consequences.

People can see that come the winter of their golden age,
they feel they weren’t knowledgeable enough.

---

And without Greatness,
there can be no legacy.

No person should ever pass,
without sharing a book of wisdom.

What a great loss that is,
what a terrible curse on the family.

What a cruelty,
to friends, the world, the universe.

---

To say I don’t have a legacy,
means to have never grown all the way up.

Never sought to inherit wisdom, never set off on quests of knowledge,
from art and music, to programming, and the greater sciences.

The collective body of wisdom that made humanity better,
is an inheritance, meant for every individual.

To be tricked out of it,
revealed a bankrupt culture, at the edge of collapse.

Without the wisdom stored in our history,
that begins with Socrates.

False leaders will manipulate,
and tear humanity apart.

Without our lessons,
we are domed to repeat old mistakes.

---

You must never see poverty as a chain or a fence,
because that is the simplest way to control you.

You need a real and effective education,
unless you have a more powerful idea that means programming computers.

And you need to shake whatever culture you were pressed into,
because it is meant to prevent you from growing up.

This means, you have to cross the Appalachian Trail,
or the equivalent in your part of the world.

While listening __and re-listening__,
to all the wisest of narrated books.

You move out of the world you were born into,
and take that ancient journey, the quest for knowledge.

Letting long adventure trails clear your mind,
release your stress, push everything away.

So that you gain the capacity to befriend the authors,
and truly comprehend, and fully inherit their wisdom.

---

I know, but the impossibility of you taking that journey,
is there on purpose, that is your chain, your fence.

But mark my words, you are not permitted,
to go through life without having comprehended thousands of wise books.

If you reject wisdom, and growing all the way up,
not only will you destroy yourself.

But also betray the future of humanity,
and become one of _its_ unwitting destroyers.

You are meant to rise,
you are meant to become a great being.
