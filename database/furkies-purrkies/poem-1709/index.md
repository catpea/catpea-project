It Is 11:48,
so this weird little poem may not be that great.

But non-the less it must be written,
as I have been bitten.

I did not finish my code this weekend,
I hope it is not a trend.

It was a bug in my code,
that I was running in node.

It was too complex,
to be caught by system checks.

And behind a fluent interface,
where errors would vanish without a trace.

There was a was state machine,
in between.

Followed by a job queue,
where my code silently threw.

The coed looked like chicken scratch,
and I did not put in the try/catch.

It was my lovely AI,
that made my queue jobs die.

Using try and catch is not bad,
in fact it made me feel glad.

You see, I tip my success odds,
by using code machines of all sorts.

I let the AI reinvent them,
to see what I can learn.

The AI can’t see the full picture,
it can’t grasp the full structure.

It is my own adventure and invention,
not a matter or AI comprehension.

Computer programs weave,
only the architect can fully perceive.

I did make the program run,
and programming with AI is really fun.

But no one can tell except for you,
what flavor is your buffer and queue.

Sometimes you catch your execution stash,
sometimes you need to exit early and crash.

As the chief architect,
Ai code is something you must always inspect.

See, AI will never ever take the glamour,
from the brilliant programmer.

Programming is such a beautiful world,
the challenge of inventing never get old.

Please take to learning how to code,
and just start with JavaScript and node.

You will never regret this wonderful game,
the challenges here, are never the same.

You always learn,
and it is always your turn.
