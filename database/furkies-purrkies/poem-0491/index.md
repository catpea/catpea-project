I suppose this is something that the birds have missed,\
I am a really nice cyclist.

All the people I warn of the angry birds,\
can't believe my words.

They have never experienced any attacks,\
I am the only one paying the bird toll and tax.

---

I bicycled back there today,\
and the moment I looked up they all flew away.

It is summer and I wanted to get a bit tanned,\
so I cut myself a switch, held a twig in my hand.

But this is no way to ride a bicycle,\
why are their hearts as cold as an icicle.

---

I think they saw my twig and a half,\
and just had a good laugh.

Birds are evolved from Dinosaurs, aka Terrible Lizards,\
maybe that is why they are so up in their gizzards,

It certainly isn't my fault,\
and no man should suffer birds assault.

---

I ride by that ugly tree every year,\
and I think what these birds want is just fear.

They are certainly not protecting their little babies,\
I think they all just have rabies.

Or just entertain themselves with those that strike some chord,\
because they are really bored.

---

When I got by passed them without attack, I smirked,\
that twig with me worked.

So, if you are ever bothered by bird or two,\
you don't have to be blue.

When the birds come just get mad,\
and [wiggle a little twig above your head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWGiWHwmhhc).
