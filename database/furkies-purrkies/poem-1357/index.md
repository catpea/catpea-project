What nobody knows,
is that geese are the masters of shadows.

Anatidaephobia is no joke,
it is just cloaked in smoke.

Once you cross a goose,
they will never let you loose.

They will watch you for many a decade,
always cloaked deep the shade.

---

Even a more startling fact,
is the explanation for how they act.

You see geese didn’t evolve long necks,
and their ancestors would even scare the T-rex.

They come from the likes of terrible lizards,
the royal beasts with iron gizzards.

They have been evolving for millions of years,
watching the shrew, and eventually you.

---

Though they are not as big,
each goose is still a bigwig.

In a word, they look down at us,
they’ll even stop a speeding bus.

---

And there is more,
to this mighty dinosaur.

When you see row of geese,
gently walking in serenity and peace.

They maybe be walking south,
without a singe complaint from their mouth.

It is an enormous undertaking,
that that gaggle is taking.

They will have to use their little feet,
rain or sleet.

---

Let me tell you something else,
about these incredible rebels

There is no mightier bird than the Michigan goose,
especially once angered and just set loose.

Despite what you might have been told,
those birds don’t fly south when it gets cold.

They go deeper into the northern frigid chill,
because Michigan geese are the real deal.

This poem was inspired by real geese,
who are still waddling around in my gym parking lot.
