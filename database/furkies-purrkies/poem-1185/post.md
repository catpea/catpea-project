As a Human Being you are to grow all they way up,
until you become a great being and make lasting and positive contributions.

But nobody who has any kind of control or leadership,
especially when it is inauthentic or ill gotten, want you to be an independent thinker.

We tolerate advertising, because we can tell when it is happening,
we can look away, even from an ATM machine.

But automation, powerful computers, and artificial intelligence,
not just language models, but the new stuff under lock and key…

Can make advertising imperceptible, and example of that,
is manipulating “Other users also watched” or bought, or listened, or visited.

We can’t tell when recommendations, or rating systems,
become carefully arranged by powerful programs.

First to make money, and later, as the case always is,
to change public opinion, beliefs, wants, aims, hopes, dreams.

---

Our only way out of these kinds of imperceptible manipulations,
is powerful, authentic, and profound self education.

Don't let anybody tell you what to study,
follow your curiosities.

Greatness is a universal, no one will ever convince you,
that growing all the way up to become a great being, is bad, or a waste of life.

Machines, be they corporate or AI will try to trick you that greatness is rare,
that brilliance and genius is completely out of your reach.

Schools will make you think that your grades define you,
but all of that is more difficult, than you going hiking, exploring, and growing up for real.

We can each tell greatness from lies, dead ends from infinite horizons,
but we must put ourselves out there in the cross roads.

You need a backpack, all the narrated books that all great beings love,
and you need to feel adventure, search for your greatness and meaning.

You will be safe, once you taste the power of your creativity, brilliance, and genius,
the resulting wisdom will make you unmovable, unshakable and unbreakable.
