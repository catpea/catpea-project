Sit your parents down, and carefully explain to them,
speaking very slowly - that while you tolerate people who pretended to learn.

You are certainly not one of those people,
and you are not interested in passing your classes by memorization.

You are not even interested in being told when to learn,
and in which sequence, and for how long – not even in how well you are doing.

---

Explain to your parents that they concocted a troubled child,
a child troubled by the universe, by complexity, acts of emergence.

In a growling tone and a heavy heart, confess,
that you are a creature of the stars, who is moved by love of wisdom and excellence.

Tell them, that while they initially thought their life was over...
they. did. not. know. the. half. of. It – for you are a force of nature.

You will leave a lasting legacy, that will forever alter Humanity’s course,
you will continue the work of philosophers, and inherit their culture in the process.

You will recognize their works as your rightful intellectual inheritance,
inheritance you will accept with mountains of well narrated books.

---

Tell them you recognize that this is a great inconvenience,
and add, that this is just a beginning…

Because not a single one of your days to come,
will ever be ordinary.

Parents, sending your child to a school,
ran by people who think they teach, is the same as bullying your own kid.

That you are poor, does not mean that you must use school as a baby sitter,
but that your child, has an opportunity to peat poverty where you failed.

To put them through what you went through,
and expect a different result, is madness.

Do not stress them out, a person is not meant to live in stress,
you won’t notice until years after, all the wrong turns that took their future away.

I will give you a singe word, a command, that you must carry out,
and you just maybe able to do things correctly: LABORATORY.

Begin putting one together, in your living room of you must,
start with used computers, so that there is always an open workstation with a GPU.

Search for refurbished and renewed, and be sure it runs linux, and nothing else,
install ollama and free llama AI models that your child or children can learn prompting on.

Get the AI to talk to each other in voice, talk about philosophy,
and life and books, and get a tutor and all tutorials on programming JavaScript and a decade later C and C++.

Programming and AI are essential,
make it happen, make it work, hire help, hire tutors, do it now, don’t think.

Help them learn how to compose techno with beat sequencers and piano rolls,
[techno is sacred, as everyone is a great composer][1]

Get them a used wall projector as cheap as $14 and plenty of big boards to paint on,
[colors and shapes are sacred, an artist paints weekly, a master traces daily][2]

[Help them assemble their first 3D printer][3] and begin learning precision modeling,
[creating real world objects is sacred, it changes eveything][4]

There is so much more, children will find their own curiosities to revolve around,
but these are good branching points.

And finally, teach them bicycling, jogging, cross country running, camping,
hiking, and aerobic fitness spiced with gradual weightlifting.

Carefully, explaining, that there is only one graduation ceremony,
walking the Triple Crown.

The Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and The Continental Divide,
if you are from Europe, then that is even better.

Be unrelenting, there is no graduation without the Triple Crown,
there may even be no graduation without Western States 100.

Your children or child, are not only going to be an impossible inconvenience to you,
but they are to rise to become a gigantic thorn in the universe's ass.

The young were never meant to grow part way up,
they were always meant to grow all the way up until they become great beings.
