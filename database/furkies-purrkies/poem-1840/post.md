Cycling standing dumbbell exercises so that your muscle groups rest,
leads to the fastest transformations.

Dumbbells are unique, a full body precision tool,
that will keep you safe and adapting at the proper pace.

It is one of the great tragedies of our age,
that the blight of Sets, Reps, Rest and Heavy…

Destroyed bodybuilding,
by making it seem out of reach, and all too demanding.

Small minded men with fragile minds,
only appreciate this mistake, as it makes them look special.

---

No more,
this is the end of lies.

The end of mediocrity,
and the end of tolerance of shortcuts.

First rule of bodybuilding, borrowed from the West Point Cadet Code,
“do not pretend, lie, cheat, or steal, and do not tolerate those who do“.

There is no forgiveness for pushing someone into deadly obesity,
by presenting fitness as harder and more complex than it really is.

---

Dumbbells, must be used correctly,
you may not begin in the middle of the rack.

You may note that you are lifting the same weight as the gym rats,
but that is nothing, because duration is more important then the weight.

They may lift between 10,000 and 20,000 times,
across two of four hours, lifting something 30 times does nothing.

---

Even if you strive for duration, you must follow the golden rule,
never so light that you can lift more, and never so heavy that you must stop.

---

Bodybuilding, is evolution of jogging, with 3 and 5 lb. dumbells,
that passes through 1980’s Sport Aerobics at 7.5 pounds.

And finally slows you down as you move non-stop with 10 and more,
changing almost weekly as your body painlessly adapts to new needs.

---

You must jog first for an hour, then learn to shuffle dance with dumbbells,
then as dumbbells get too heavy to dance with, walk, twist and turn.

The faster you move, and harder you breathe, the more fat you burn,
the heavier you lift, even as you are forced to slow down, the more you grow.

---

All of this can be glanced, your first or second month of jogging,
as you legs begin sprouting muscles.

But unlike a jogger,
you keep adding weights.

Not so light that you can handle more,
not so heavy that you will be forced to stop.

---

But there is even more to it,
you will not be able to safely flip tires, bench press and squat at 80.

But dancing with dumbbells that keep you muscular,
will always be available to you, your body will always try to adapt.

Because dumbbell workouts are a standing and/or walking exercise,
they transform your entire body, and keep you musculature well balanced.

Dumbbells enable a life long workout routine,
be it driven by dancing, jogging, or walking.

A routine that you can always count on,
to keep you fit and safe.
