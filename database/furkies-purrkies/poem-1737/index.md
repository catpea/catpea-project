It is very simple, and you already know it,
deep down – and yes it is all connected.

Poverty, causes fear,
that limits ability to learn.

And when education is further disabled,
by desperately poor teachers.

Who must put the food on the table,
above all else.

In the process they will coerce students,
into memorization.

As you have no doubt discoveries yourself,
on paper…

Memorization is indistinguishable,
from comprehension.

---

Education is not about knowledge,
it is about tools of creativity.

It is a about inheritance of wisdom,
and culture of greatness.

You don’t memorize the formulas,
you independently reinvent them.

---

But the key thing here,
is inheritance of culture of greatness.

When this is denied,
humanity is robbed of a sense of dingily.

A permeating sense of dignity,
prevents emergence of dictators.

They are asked to step down in disgrace,
long before their rise.

---

You have understand that poverty is a political failure,
and stop being afraid of it so that you can learn for real.

And gain this is not just about education,
but you inheriting the cuture of great being.

And gaining a sense of dignity,
that will prevent manipulators from rising.

There is nothing that a crook can do for you,
but send your grandchildren to fight in war.

A war they ignited, if not started,
for the sole purpose…

Of rebooting the economy,
that they themselves collapsed with corruption.

---

For all the terrible things,
self education is the only way to fix what is broken.

Meaningful education prevents,
it changes the future before it hapends.

It works its magic,
before the corruption emerges.

---

You can’t sit in a classroom,
waiting for education to be beamed into you.

The only think good about high school,
is that at that point you are still too young.

But you are not allowed to just memorize for grades,
or you will destroy your world.

Certainly the world of your grand kids,
you have to take education seriously.

If you have something,
more powerful than learning programming go for it.

But if you don’t the meoemnt this poem ends,
you go on a bookmarking safari.

To find your favoirite video channels that will teach you,
[JavaScript/ES6+][0], HTML/XML, CSS Electron/nw.js and node.js

Don’t let people pull you into TypeScript or Rust,
and C/C++ will come to you if you have time in life.

An untyped or ducktyped language can be translated,
into whatever by AI, but you will never need that.

Becasue programmers of other languages, will spend years,
reinventing the browser, XML, CSS and web technologies.

They don’t know it,
but that is where they are all headed.

---

You should graduate High School as a powerful programmer,
and hope to be held back to make room for exposing fake education.

Your future employer is that is what you want,
wants to see you standing up for knowledge.

Not pretending to memorize for a good GPA,
because that is fraud, that keep you uneducated.

---

When you are ready,
you need to set off for adventure.

Crossing the Appalachian, Pacific Crest,
and Continental Divide Trails – please be safe.

And you have to listen,
to all the worlds most powerful narrated books.

---

This is where you will have the maturity and mind,
to accept your intellectual inheritance.

All the world of great beings,
and much of each of their culture.

Do not wait for spring or summer,
you need to [master camping in the snow][1].

---

It is true that you are not a passive observer,
though you should aim to become a powerful participant.

A writer, an artist,
someone who can speak to the world.

Your personal aim is to grow all the wy up,
and become a great being.

But in the larger scope of things,
to bring back the barrier of dignity that cuts down madmen.

And prevent the worst of the future,
before the bad people emerge, so that they will never endanger you.

In a word, you are a warrior,
you & your generation, is almost all that the future has.
