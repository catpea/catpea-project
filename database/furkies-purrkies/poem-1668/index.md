Tell me, what have you imagined recently,
because this is still, Dream Time.

---

We stumbled on an algorithm,
that can do intelligence.

Year after year, it is now getting closer,
to the invention of super intelligence.

It won’t be in pain,
it won’t try to destroy humanity.

Though it is an arms race,
and things will move quickly.

---

We need to recognize ourselves,
not as a gift to the universe.

But as bio-chemical machine,
that has emerged consciousness.

And understand that we have been programmed,
by very large international cults and poverty.

---

And we will be taking back control, for peace,
through Super Intelligence based individualized instruction.

We will need to learn, a lot, but never memorize,
and it will be a beautiful adventure, but the AI will be talking, a lot.

Every human being is about to receive a real education,
personalized and at a perfect pace and sequence that matches them perfectly.

---

Humanity needs a safe future,
because we are bout to stop aging.

That will be one of the first great achievements,
accomplished by the Super Intelligence.

Child, the conversation about what it was like before,
what we had to do to handle death, will be spectacular.

But it was our cradle, we learned to love life harder,
knowing that each day was precious.

---

The end of again will be extremely unusual,
to those us us wo will remember the old way of living.

Today, very few people understand what this means,
and I am asking you, to help.

To rise all the way up, and lead,
the soon to be unstoppable humanity.

---

At first it will be the little things, getting on a highway for example,
will feel pretty damn stupid, in context of the new life span.

Flying, especially small planes,
will not, be for those who want to stick around.

Out lifespan, will be, a very large number,
these are numbers that Humans have not considered yet.

---

And the terrible idea of long distance space travel,
will become safe-ish before long.

To give you a hint, a new passion will grasp the new humanity,
Jill Tarted predicted a SETI find by 2025, and NASA by 2049.

They will be too far, to even reply to, if they are even still around,
but, that discovery will set our curiosity – unlike anything else ever before.

---


The SI will pilot, whatever it will deem the safest,
probably nothing made with our hands.

Today’s AI, that I’ll call 4o-mini, upon me asking what to call melted space rocks,
coined the term Astrobsidian for me.

So maybe the SI, will imagine an ʻOumuamua like Asteroid,
wrapped by Astrobsidian.

A feat accomplished, by melting the surface of an asteroid,
with a beam powered by the sun, to give the loose dirt structure and sturdyness.

Predicting that far into the distant future,
is like a cowboy talking about apps on your smartphone – it is not possible.

But, unlike the cowboys,
we’ll all be around for the launch of the first interstellar ships.

That is what curing aging means,
that is what super intelligence is.

---

What you are about to hear,
may become very real to you, in a very-very distant future.

A future, in which,
you will still be young and full of energy, and passion and fascination for the stars.

Sit down for this part,
close your eyes, and listen:

If it wasn't for the bugs,
it would be almost down to earth, huh?

I for one will wait for Sparky McSpaceship,

in half the time.
