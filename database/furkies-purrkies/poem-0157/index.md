May all your days add,

may you never feel sad.

Because it is hard to say,

what things may.

We certainly know not,

the world; dot for dot.

What we do know,

is not to resign or live low.

Because life is one,

so live as bright as the sun.

And as wise,

as the true sunrise.

And as smart,

as the unbroken heart.

Growing is your right,

your most magnificent might.

Do not waste a single day,

and always walk your own way.
