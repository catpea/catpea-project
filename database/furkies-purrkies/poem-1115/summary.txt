When Learning For Real, Every Lesson Is A Big Deal
Tuesday • March 21st 2023 • 11:01:23 pm

You don’t have bad grades,
you have insane teachers.
– Abraham Lincoln

To learn something for real,
you need three things.

---

One, You have to be really, really curious,
about the thing.

If you are not curious, you will not learn,
you will only memorize for long enough to pass a test.

You will be made to sell out for a GPA,
so that your teacher can continue the charade and get paid.

Tricking you into memorization, aside from being utterly useless,
is extremely unethical, because it disables your mind.

To take good old math as example,
not only memorization does nothing for you.

Watching you recalling a formula that you don’t understand,
is really embarrassing and sad.

You Can’t learn math, because math is not a real subject,
it is a thing that seems like a subject, but it is not.

Similarly the question “Why are we here?” sounds great,
it is impressive, large, coherent, but it is not a real question.

It has been called a silly question,
it is a really good signal for a therapist, nit not a real question.

The field of mathematics exists,
you can make a really cool map of it.

But mathematics the class, the set of lectures,
the idea that here is a list of steps you need to learn math, is stupid.

If you have a really good math teacher,
there are two things that block them from helping you.

If you go off script, learn on your own,
away from a textbook, you will fail the final test, or near enough.

And your teacher needs to get paid,
they will do anything to get paid.

They will hold up a textbook with the word math,
and say this is proof math exists.

These are the steps yo need to take, not because it is true,
but because she can hide behind the authority of the book.

It is her way of cutting you off from learning for leal,
so that you shut up and she gets paid.

If she does not get paid, she can’t put food on the table,
she has to look for another job.

Your authentic grasp on mathematics,
does not matter to your teacher.

The only thing that matters,
is the fantasy that you can learn math by memorization.

The only ting that matters is that she checks all the boxes,
so that she gets paid.

And to make sure, you can’t prove a damn thing,
she will prevent herself from ever asking.

Are my kids really learning math,
d...

... to do the math part – see what I mean.

Two Interesting Screesavers to look at are XscreenSaver on Linux,
and After Dark on the old Mac, it is old software, but lovely.

Here you are learning math and programming,
with the aim of sharing your screensavers with the word.

It is true that we live in a world where people close their laptop lid,
so just make your screensavers that much more interesting.

Alliteratively you can set an aim to learn math and programming,
by building strange things in [P5.js][2]

Make releasing video and book tutorials an aim,
share with eh world what you have learned.

Now in school context, to really learn music,
you need to set an aim of releasing an album in the first semester.

Generative Art AI will take are of your cover,
do your music composition in [LMMS][3],

And witness how much more profound your Music education,
where it creates an aim of releasing a singe minimalist techno album on bandcamp for example.

Music composition with an aim to make songs,
takes a couple of hours to get a hand of.

And [less than two days to compose your first song][4],
we are all born composers.

It is just that ineffective education,
takes that from us.

---

Finally, one is curiosity, two is context, three is an aim,
bu there ais also the matter of growing up.

No human being is allowed to grow a lite bit,
nor would anybody want to.

So to grow up, means to grow all the way up, until we become Great Beings,
and on our way there we will find our meaning.

All you need here is a hunger for real knowledge from real books,
written by great beings held in high esteem by all the worlds authentic intellectuals.

In your quest to comprehend their great though,
you will not be able to help, but to enter into their culture.

And eventually in your culture of greatness,
make your own unique contributions to the wold.

As you stand on the shoulders of giants,
and in turn lend yours to countess many that follow.
