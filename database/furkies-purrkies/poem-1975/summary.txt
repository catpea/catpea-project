I Was There On The Balcony, But I Remembered My Soul Too Late

# My Final Confession

*I don't know if anyone will read this. Maybe a nurse will toss it in the bin. Maybe one of my grandchildren will find it and wonder who I really was. Maybe some young protester, years from now, will use it to light a cigarette and warm their hands.*

*That's fine. It belongs to whoever needs it.*

I was a banker. A very successful one. My name meant something in certain rooms where futures were traded like playing cards. My voice moved millions with a breath. I dined with senators and advised presidents. I got rich — not by creating anything, but by maneuvering numbers like knives. I slept on Egyptian cotton, drank wine older than my children, and considered poverty an unfortunate miscalculation in other people's spreadsheets.

And yet... I wept during Occupy.

Alone, in my corner office, lights off, city glowing beneath me like a circuit board. I saw them in Zuccotti Park — the kids with their cardboard signs, the mothers counting change for subway fare, the out-of-work electricians, the burned-out teachers — and something in me cracked. Not guilt, not then. Just recognition. They looked like the people I grew up around. They *were* the people I left behind.

I watched from the windows, paralyzed by my own success. I told myself they didn't understand economics. That the system was flawed, yes, but too complex to dismantle. That someone else — bolder, poorer, braver — would fix it eventually.

I was wrong. We all were.

And now, as I die in a bed that costs more than most make in a year, I need to say what I never had the courage to speak aloud:

**We could have changed everything.**

We had the money. God help me, we had *oceans* of it. Enough to end hunger ten times over. Enough to cancel every medical debt, house every person sleeping rough, educate every child, and still — *still* — leave dynasties behind. But we hoarded it. We played God with spreadsheets and stock options, pretending we earned what we merely extracted, pretending the people we crushed were just market casualties, collateral damage in the grand algorithm of growth.

We could have given every person — every single child — a true beginning. A clean slate, unchained from their parents' poverty, their grandparents' trauma. We co...

...alive. This was not the invisible hand of the market. These were our hands. *My* hands.

To those I harmed — directly or by silence — I cannot ask forgiveness. Only understanding. I was a coward. I chose comfort over courage. I said "later" until there was no time left. I convinced myself that charity dinners were enough, that donations were absolution, that being "one of the good ones" meant something while I stayed inside the machine, oiling its gears with other people's dreams.

And to my colleagues who feel nothing, who will die with portfolios intact and souls bankrupt — I say this: you could still become human. *Tonight*. You could still break ranks. Transfer the wealth. Leak the documents. Burn the whole beautiful terrible machine to the ground and build something worthy of our species. Leave your final years better than your prime.

Or don't.

But know that when your last breath comes — and it will come, no portfolio can stop it — you will hear the same question I hear now, echoing in the empty chambers where a heart should have been:

***"Why didn't you do more, when you had everything?"***

If there is a God, I hope He accepts this page as proof I finally saw the truth — too late to matter, but not too late to confess. If there is no God, then let this be a message in a bottle — floating through time to a better world I will never live to see.

Tell them the secret history. Tell them about the meetings where we laughed about "necessary unemployment." Tell them about the algorithms designed to keep them desperate. Tell them how we calculated exactly how poor they needed to be to keep working, keep borrowing, keep believing the lie that one day they'd join us.

Tell them: we were not titans. We were not geniuses. We were merely men who found the combination to the safe and decided to lock everyone else out.

Tell them: we had a chance to become angels.

We chose to remain thieves.

Tell them: I'm sorry.

Tell them: it's not too late for them.

Tell them: we could have ended scarcity. We chose to manufacture it.

Tell them: every revolution they dream of, we could have led.

Tell them: they are not poor because they failed.

They are poor because we succeeded.

*Forgive us.*

*No — don't forgive us.*

*Exceed us.*
