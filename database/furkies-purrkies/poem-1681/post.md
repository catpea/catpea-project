You just need four things, thick [adult sized tail for about $15][1],
[4 or 6 inch wide foam weightlifting belt for $20][2]…

[And sturdy steel wire paper towel holder][3], I got mine from a dollar store,
and finally sharp wire with which you can pierce the foam weightlifting belt.

It is hard to make your own tail, especially the fluffy large thick tails,
about as wide as a two liter water bottle and as long as your arm.

If you are going to try it, go to a used clothing store that has costumes,
or fluffy pillows, or even furry blankets, and get your fabric from there.

6 inch wide weightlifting belt world for me, but 4 inch could work as well,
it should be a synthetic one, preferably with a mesh surface.

This way, you won’t sweat too much, and you can easily pierce it with a wire,
you won’t be able to pierce a lather one and it will be hot.

It does get warm beneath the belt, leather or synthetic.
But I’ve been wearing my tail to the gym since mid September,

About three weeks, three hours a day, five days a week,
and I dance with dumbbells constantly, and I feel fine.

I burned holes for zip ties in my previous version of the tail,
the heat neatly sealed everything off, so that no fluff came out.

But zip ties, need huge holes, a sharp wire does not leave any visible marks,
if you remove it, even if just to reposition something.

I just used a 24 gauge galvanized steel wire, and I pierced through the belt twice,
so that both sharp ends were on the outside.

Once I looped it around the paper towel holder and twisted the ends together,
I curved the pointy mess into the belt.

It will never pierce the belt,
it is just a nice way not to have any pointy edges anywhere.

I ended up with 6 or 8 wire loops on the paper holder,
my $1.25 one is just fine, I even bent it up a bit.

---

I don't recommend going around the belt with tape or long shoelace,
to attach the paper towel holder.

Don’t add anything between you and your workout clothes,
though you may have luck with thick thread and big needle.

It is essentially the same things the wire, though classier,
and nether the wire nor the thread will stick out.

The tail on the other end will pull it in,
it will counter sink the loop.

---

Consider a more wire like paper towel holder, rather than metal rod,
as you may wish to give it a little curve upwards.

And mine is U shaped, so I pointed the flatness upwards,
so it is not just a singe wire that can scratch through the tail.

If you are going to bend anything, though, do that before attaching it,
just in case a weld snaps off or something.

And use a paper towel holder instead of some thick wire.
they have a nice round loop a the top.

If if you cover it up with fabric,
you still don’t want to have anything pointy back there.

As a joke one of your friends may wish to perform a Hump,
or just a Heimlich Maneuver, and you only want to stab them a little.

In my first version, I covered the base of the paper towel holder,
with black neoprene, same color as the belt.

But in my second version, where my belt is red, to match my wresting singlet,
I put some acrylic paint on the shiny paper towel holder, and left it visible.

It looks technological, like it doubles as a cat butt radar metal detector,
with convenient broadcast antenna functionality, and a focused EMP pulse meow.

Which can double as a bit flipper in RAM chips,
where I can introduce bugs in other wise bug free software to gain root.

---

And in fact I already used the antena once, as one of the older men at the gym,
started having, what I termed as photographic incontinence.

And was taking pictures of his arms, with my bouncy blurry ass in the background,
so I figured, I need to slow down my workout and photo-bomb the weird bastard.

Even just to free him from his terrible curse of techno incontinence,
and I stuck my furry antenna out like a Nuclear Submarine in slow motion.

And he finally had his proof that bodybuilders are mostly feline,
and he no longer needs to return to the gym as he is part something else.

To which I say, no matter what you are, if you got a tailbone, your tail not gone,
and without a prosthetic tail, yours just really tiny.

Which is the opposite of the results,
you expect from the gym.

So get a bushy tail,
and make sure it is to scale.
