It is a frigid 22F degrees,
everyone is cold; except for the angry geese.

This morning on my way to they gym,
the geese were looking rather grim.

They were waiting for a hamburger bun,
thawing their feathery butts in the morning sun.

---

And while it is true,
that they see us as a friendly large shrew.

Recalling us from a haze,
of the prehistoric dinosaur days.

They are getting somewhat annoyed,
suspecting we are a thing to avoid.

---

They may not fly south this year,
betting that snow won't be severe.

I think they are getting pretty mad,
that we ruined the climate a tad.

They are starting to pay attention to us,
thinking that we're all rather sus.

---

Who are these fat bastards they ask,
secretly eyeing us from dawn to dusk.

I think their point is fair,
and they should stare.

We all know about the extinction of the dinosaur.
climate change is nothing we can ignore,

---

They are right to have their suspicions,
and we are wrong to blindly trust the politicians.

Humanity is not to become a runaway system,
we must each independently rise to greatness and wisdom.

Until then, there will be more and more pissed off geese,
and if we fail, their anger will only increase.
