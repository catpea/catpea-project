The Remarkable Human Capacity For Being Fooled
Sunday • December 14th 2025 • 5:26:26 pm

Here is a fact that I find endlessly fascinating: the human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each capable of forming thousands of connections with other neurons, creating a network of such staggering complexity that if you tried to count every synaptic connection at a rate of one per second, you would need roughly 3 million years to finish. You would also, one imagines, be rather bored by the end.

This magnificent organ—the most complex structure in the known universe, capable of composing symphonies, solving differential equations, and experiencing the sublime terror of existence—can also be convinced to buy a pet rock.

In 1975, a California advertising executive named Gary Dahl sat in a bar listening to his friends complain about their pets. Pets, they noted, required feeding, walking, veterinary care, and emotional attention. Dahl, in what one can only describe as either a stroke of genius or a devastating commentary on consumer culture, announced that he had the perfect pet: a rock.

He was joking. But then he stopped joking.

Dahl purchased smooth stones from a builder's supply store in Rosarita Beach, Mexico, for about a penny each. He packaged them in cardboard boxes designed to look like pet carriers, complete with air holes and a bed of straw. He wrote a 32-page instruction manual—"The Care and Training of Your Pet Rock"—filled with commands like "sit" and "stay" (at which, the manual noted, rocks excelled) and warnings about teaching your rock to "attack" (which required caution).

Within six months, Gary Dahl had sold over 1.5 million pet rocks at $3.95 each, becoming a millionaire from what was, by any objective measure, the sale of ordinary rocks in fancy packaging.

I mention this not to mock the purchasers—though one is tempted—but to make a point that will become rather important as we proceed: **the same cognitive architecture that enables human beings to land spacecraft on distant moons also makes us susceptible to purchasing rocks as pets.**

This is not a bug. It's a feature. Sort of.

### The Brain That Fooled Itself

The human brain, you see, did not evolve to discern truth. It evolved to survive. These are not the same thing.

Consider our ancestors on the African savanna, some 200,000 ...

### Conclusion: The View From Here

We have, in this text, ranged rather widely. We have visited the African savanna and the Vienna General Hospital. We have met Thomas Midgley Jr. and Ignaz Semmelweis. We have contemplated pet rocks and manufactured doubt. We have considered why smart people believe dumb things and why institutions resist inconvenient truths.

Yet, there is a thread connecting these disparate topics, and it is this: **the human capacity for self-deception is matched only by the human capacity for self-correction.**

We are the species that invented lead gasoline and the species that banned it. We are the species that created the tobacco industry and the species that exposed it. We are the species that builds systems of deception and the species that tears them down.

Which of these capacities prevails is not predetermined. It depends on choices—on whether we build educational systems that cultivate critical thinking, on whether we create institutions that reward truth-telling, on whether we summon the courage to ask uncomfortable questions and accept uncomfortable answers.

The view from here, I confess, is ambiguous. We can see both the scale of the deception and the possibility of its exposure. We can see both the forces arrayed against truth and the stubborn persistence of those who insist on telling it.

What we cannot see—what no one can see—is how the story ends. That depends on us.

But I will say this: the very fact that you are reading these words is evidence for hope. You have chosen to learn about the mechanisms of deception, which means you are less likely to fall for them. You have chosen to engage with uncomfortable truths, which means you are practicing the very skills that make manipulation harder.

A pet rock cannot read. It cannot think. It cannot question. It is exactly what it appears to be: an inert lump of mineral, doing nothing, changing nothing, learning nothing.

You are not a pet rock.

You are a human being, heir to 86 billion neurons and 200,000 years of survival and the accumulated knowledge of countless generations who asked questions, sought answers, and passed what they learned to those who came after.

Use it well.
