High School Trouble
Thursday • May 11th 2023 • 10:56:14 pm

You have to learn programming,
and learn how to build [tiny companies][0].

We don't know exactly what happened with schools,
no one aimed to betray you.

But you are being tricked,
into an ineffective and useless education.

And if you just keep following the directions you are given,
you will spend the rest of your life in poverty and regret.

---

The politicians are wrong, your teachers are wrong,
your parents have no idea what is going on...

And the guidance counselor is always wrong,
he may not even perceive you as a human being but an obstacle.

Narrated books written by great beings,
books loved by all the worlds intellectuals, are however the correct direction.

You can see how the world's intellectuals,
love to debate, but never hate or battle.

They know which side is wrong,
and they pull each other up with profound wisdom and greatness.

The intellectuals are the best of humanity,
and they are its future and peace.

And you, are not to work yourself to madness,
but to grow all the way up and become a great being.

So that you can help others rise too,
so that we can get to the future without anymore wars and errors.

---

There is little evidence of schools failing,
the teachers grade themselves with your collective GPA...

And state tests, just test state text books,
which are optimized for memorization, to show great progress.

---

But if you are lucky, you will catch the principal,
giving preferential treatment to students marked as gifted.

There are no gifted students,
but some people lean something on their own.

And some principals get a glimpse of how pretty that is,
and they try to save it.

Because they know, schools can only destroy,
betray, sell out, they can only take.

If someone already has something,
some principals on the brink of unraveling.

Will try to save it,
in hopes of saving their own self respect.

In hopes of some kind of,
forgiveness, for what they have done to everyone else.

---

Aside from most parent having received the same kind of education,
that you are now going through...

And never really becoming educated because of school,
sans some half memorized formulas...

And thus having earned whatever education they do have,
on their own, in their own sequence, and at their own pace...

There is o...

...that demon? Or would you answer, 'Never have I heard anything more divine'? ”

and another,
Who includes diversity and is Nature,
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,
Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,
Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,
Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.

Please understand, that programming and launching small businesses,
is not an island that you have to get to.

It is the modern hammer and nails,
that you keep in your drawer in your kitchen, when you need to repair something.

Fake education is stealing your ability to use tools,
and rise out of poverty.

No one intended for things to be this way,
they just wanted to make it look real.

Please, start with [p5.js][1], move onto [svelte][2],
and then [node.js][3].

Begin keeping a backpack by the door,
slowly start filling it up with what you may need in your adventures.

And get bug spray, and mosquitoes repellent sticks,
and never, ever, do what you are told, because it easier when you are not being yelled at.

Your stay here on Earth, is limited, to make your way towards your meaning,
you have to begin rising profound book by profound book, until your grow all the way up, and become a great being.

You will discover everything you will ever need,
on your way there.
