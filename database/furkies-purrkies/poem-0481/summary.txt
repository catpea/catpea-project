There Are No Ordinary People
Thursday • June 24th 2021 • 9:34:19 pm

I suppose there probably are people who, to their own detriment, pretend to be ordinary,\
so that they can do the absolute minimum in life, but that just cuts them off from growing up.

When it comes to the complete, cheerful, inquisitive, and healthy minds,\
they are perfectly unique; nothing standard; nothing ordinary.

There is no way that another being could replace a friend,\
no two people are alike, no two beings the same interests, nobody dreams the same dreams.

And that is just considering a single moment in time,\
lives across time can't be the same, at all.

Not only are there no two individuals that are the same,\
but it is also impossible to live the same life.

Therefore,\
there are no ordinary people.

Moreover,\
we should all live extraordinary lives.

When we are free to grow,\
we flourish in the most magnificent of ways.

This may come as a surprise, but when we are not limiting ourselves,\
and when we can freely grow, and grow up, we become extraordinary, just by living free.

See, the alarm clock is not your heart,\
it is not supposed to keep you living in a square grid at maximum performance.

Often something like this is very convenient to other people,\
and even the friendliest of them may conspire against you to continue your daily routine.

But we are not robots,\
we are not automatons.\
we are not machines.

In this text, I will present to you with a small recipe for getting back on track, by jogging and adventuring,\
and give you examples of Colorful, Funny, and Or Profound Lives, by means of reading a selection of audio books titles.

Again, people pretend to be ordinary, and may expect you to be ordinary as well,\
but when we are left to grow up, we will become extraordinary, simply by leading Authentic Lives.

We have this issue, with all to easily accepting facts of the culture that we are born into,\
and we all to easily listen to people in authority.

[Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug),\
is a way of finding out who we are, and setting aside what we were told to become, or what we assumed we were, or what we assumed others wanted us to be, and all that.

Most adventurers,\
don't really do the full adventure.

And most people,\
don't even know, how far reaching the thing is....
