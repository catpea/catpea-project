Preface

There are two things that are trying to get you in school. different sides of the same coin.

It is not just ineffective or fake education.

But it is also the crappy culture of crappy friends. Stay away from "Get This" and "Get That", they'll get you to fall to fell better about themselves. God eat dog.

To break out, you will have to fail, while daring greatly.

Use the library, listen to all the narrated books written by great beings.

---

If your other half is in your school, they will see you. Because you will be failing classes, while being sucess at everything you do.

Shine.

---

We all have our starts, where we break away,
in minutes, you will receive the finest start there is.

A bunch of brilliant programming code,
that you can track and comprehend.

But let me just say, I myself had fours little awakenings,
so that you know what they look like.

My first start was a book very much like the Short History of Nearly Everything,
it was old, and it said that Mars had deacons and life.

Percival Lowell himself, invited me to a universe,
that is hard to comprehended today.

---

My second start was a Linguistics or Science book written in humor,
it was extremely smart and sophisticated.

The school year ended, though there was never time,
to read it past the first pages, I did it bring it with me to America.

---

My third start was a Computer Information class,
where I was accused of cheating, which made the bullies laugh.

But I didn’t cheat,
programming is pretty easy.

---

And my fourth start, was after the bullies,
invited older bullies.

And it was no longer safe or rational to go to school,
I went to game arcades instead.

I never had money to play, I just watched Street Fighter, Simpsons,
and I never stopped watching.

I love watching Souls Game runs,
I have to re-watch Skyrim with all the mods.

I love that user interface, with the sky globe,
and underground levels.

But, this start is really about pixelart,
I never appreciated 3D graphics Wolfenstein 3D.

---

Now I am giving you the finest start there is,
Your AI will explain it all.

I don’t need to describe the code,
but I will tell you this.

While programming is functions, ifs, loops,
and groups of functions that share data called Objects.

There also exist machines, they are old,
and they are very powerful.

React, a user interface framework is best paired with redux,
redux is a machine.

The latest version of svelte that uses runes,
they live in a state/computed/effect machines.

But there are other machines,
that you can study and combine.

And I will give you the list,
and a couple of links to the same code.

---

The reason why this is a fine start,
is because AI rewrote the bloated human code into elegant beauty.

It even features modern-like AI,
a single layer perception, very spicy, I left that one for last.

You can read the code, trace the syntax,
copy and paste into your AI and ask for variations.

---

Try to put a team together; at the library,
so that you can rebuild your school inside out, programming first.

After you are kicked out for failing to pretend to learn,
co-found a company together.

For AI based, rouge-like, programming first,
self directed, self paced, school.

The rouge like nature, is of course the key,
that is the diploma, built live every day.

Use these following stats,
for start.


**Knowledge (K)**
Represents the depth of understanding in various subjects. Higher levels indicate mastery of concepts.

**Creativity (C)**
Measures the ability to think outside the box and generate innovative ideas or solutions.

**Critical Thinking (CT)**
Assesses the ability to analyze information, solve problems, and make informed decisions.

**Resilience (R)**
Indicates perseverance in overcoming challenges and setbacks during quests.

**Adaptability (A)**
Measures how well a student can adjust to new situations and learn from experiences.

**Philosophy (P)**
Evaluates the ability to think deeply about ethical questions and the human experience, fostering critical discussions.

**Endurance (En)**
Measures stamina and the ability to persist through long-term projects and challenges.

**Strength (S)**
Reflects physical and mental strength, indicating the ability to tackle demanding tasks and challenges.

**Resistance (Re)**
Assesses the capacity to withstand stress and adversity, promoting mental fortitude.

**Humanity (H)**
Represents empathy, compassion, and the understanding of importance of convergence on wisdom.

**Leadership (L)**
Evaluates the ability to guide and inspire others during collaborative projects or group quests.

**Communication (Com)**:
Assesses the effectiveness of verbal and written communication skills in presenting ideas and findings.

**Self-Reflection (SR)**:
Indicates the capacity for introspection and learning from past experiences to improve future performance.

You got this,
you can save education, you can help the world advance.
