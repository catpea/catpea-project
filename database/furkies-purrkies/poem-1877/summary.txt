Architectural Programming For Ladies; Or, Teaching Your AI Who The Boss Is
Monday • April 21st 2025 • 7:23:38 pm

If you bear with me in one more jibberish poem,
we will close the AI programming research chapter.

With the unusual conclusion that it is better to desctibe code for AI,
than actually write it yourself; freeing you to invent and strategize.

In a poem entitled “[Strategic Software Development For Girls New To Programming][1]”,
we explored a simple AI friendly Application Architecture.

Then, in “[The Miracle Requirements Document; Or Investigating The Power Of Artificial Intelligence][2]”,
we experimented with [letting the AI create a System Requirement Document][3].

Today, we look beyond Requirement Documents,
and put the parts together into a coherent vision.

Ignore the confusing words, just skim over them at first,
and understand that you can build an empire, with just well informed text.

You don't actually want to write the code,
that takes decades.

What you need is to ease yourself into a world of software development,
in this bright new age of ever improving Artificial Intelligence.

Ignore the negative commenters, programmers invested in the old ways of manual programming,
cannot help but to try to push you away from this new road.

But they represent the old ways, the manual cranky ways,
fill of complaints, advice that leads to nothing.

That is the advice of old incontinent men,
that yell at clouds in a desperate search for their medicine.

The biggest problem you are facing today,
is lack of competence on the part of AI companies.

There was announcement a day ago or so that the leading AI company,
embedded hidden/non-printable characters for the purpose of watermarking.

You probably can’t sell a WebExtension to convert the characters,
into little Clown Emoji, as it is probably a violation of user agreement.

And, when you create a large Requirements Document, as we have,
you will have to pay for a premium AI to comprehend it.

The leading AI, asked me to log-in, and gave truncated answers,
[for a 404 line Requirement Document][4] a small part of Application Architecture we described.

To address this dumb discovery, large requirement documents,
have to be broken down, and not into parts, as that would confuse AI.

But into stand-alone programs, so the Database part explained in,
“Strategic Softwar...

...d in the future, that will certainly be the case.

Finally, allow me to clearly state,
that an Application, large or small, is no longer code based.

It is now a directory tree of requirements documents,
and architectural specifications, such as class breakdowns.

That describes multiple, well named, stand alone applications,
that integrate together in simple and obvious ways.

Remote via HTTP calls to various URLS, exactly like browsers do it,
[and Libraries, via nice, tidy and predictable API][6]

You don’t have to learn programming,
but you will pick it up along the way.

More important than code,
are the architectural patterns.

And they are a human invention,
made to simplify programming.

They will pose no challenge,
and all you need to get started.

Is to watch videos about Application Architectures,
talk to AI about what Application Internals work.

And then as you start reasoning about your Applications,
break everything down into small programs, their plugins, and even classes.

The way you keep track of all this is just text,
your own wiki, and tables of contents that you memorize and rely on.

---

This is not about sidestepping programming,
this is a programmers dream.

This is about having a team of powerful programs,
do all the coding for you.

As you drive your Side-projects, Startups, and Companies,
often staffed primarily by AI, into the future.

You are not meant to be the programmer anymore,
today, you are the CEO, the project lead, and the senior strategist.

---

[I recommend that your first undertaking, is a desktop application][7],
that puts all of the above into a simple user interface.

Where not only you build an empire,
but others can buy the program, and built their dreams too.
