Though their bird song,
is not very long.

The seagulls have finally sung,
and the Michigan Spring has sprung.

---

It is a tradition of old,
in this part of the word.

When Michigan weather is cold and dull,
we wait for the announcement of the gull.

And when they finally return to their habitats,
we know to put away out coats and hats.

Until then nobody dares,
and most dress like fat bears.

---

All seagulls are all very nice,
they are the __true__ birds of paradise.

Oh yes, that is why their favorite location.
Is often wherever you vacation.

---

They are very social birds,
and like to chit-chat in herds.

They get a tingle,
when they mingle.

But they love people too,
especially if you have a snack or two.

They enjoy music and rhyme,
they listen to it all the time.

And when you see them prance,
they are actually doing a happy little dance.

---

They are all extremely smart,
some even dabble in pebble art.

Of course they really love to sail,
traveling on ships around the world without a fail.

It is that they are the happy kitty-cats of the sea,
and lakes and oceans are simply their cup of tea.

But by far, their favorite little thing,
is cheerfully announcing Spring.
