A Remedy For Old Age: Because If You Are Cold, Then You May Be Getting Old
Thursday • January 29th 2026 • 8:41:15 pm

My own grandmother taught me this,
by walking as fast as the little me could run,
and often run out of breath,
*chasing her beneath the winter sun.*

Listen carefully, this is a big deal,
*for movement is how our bodies heal.*
There is no such thing as old age.

Despite what you are told,
it is all that sitting that makes you old.

You are not the elf on the shelf—
the body needs stimulation to renew itself.

If we just sit around,
we run it into the ground.

---

Long ago became fit when we were babies,
*no ifs, no buts, no maybes.*
We knew how to grow strong,
*we practiced all day long.*

By taking baby steps, and bigger steps,
until we could
*walk and waddle,*
*skip and skidaddle,*
and then slowly jog,
*through sunshine, rain, and fog,*
and run around all day,
without running out of breath.

---

Just imagine how sickly we would have been,
if we stayed home, *too cautious to roam.*
It is exactly the same
for pushing back old age's claim.
We can't slow down,
or our body will shut down.

---

The older you get, the holier you become,
for the precious memories that live in you.
It is your duty to age with grace,
*to keep the sparkle in your face.*

You have to walk to the store, library, and *park,*
*from first morning light to after dark.*
And then you walk to the gym,
from time to time, *on a whim.*
Eventually,
you make your way to the trails.
This is where you stop feeling cold,
and you stop being old.

But your journey does not end there,
*for now you have wisdom to share.*
You must now become a guide,
*and walk with others, side by side,*
*helping them find their second youth,*
*showing them this simple truth.*

Put an A-team together and then a club,
*make your neighborhood the hub.*
We don't really age at all,
*we only age when we stall—*
we just have to fight to stay young,
*with every step and every rung.*

Just think of all the lessons you will teach,
Think of all the heights you are yet to reach.
