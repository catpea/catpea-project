The following advice,
is for people of all ages.

---

When kitty cats grow up among other kitties,
they behave very much like wise lions, kings of their patch of land.

When they grow up among dogs,
they pant like dogs, and do other dogie things, inducing fetch.

When they grow up in a stable where horseys train,
you bet your fanny they will learn to trot and prance.

And when they grow up among humans,
they again wish to be more like us.

---

For example, when you go to the restroom,
and your kitty climbed into your underwear.

They are trying to tell you,
that they too wish they has underwear and pants.

I kid you not, that is one of the few times,
they can easily get into underwear.

Kitten fashion, is a little bit different than human,
kitties don’t like wearing, exactly.

They like being wrapped in fantastic colors,
they want to be able to easily get out.

Which is great, because you don’t have to stich anything,
other than your funny bone, that is.

Listen, more than anything else,
cats love hats, they love them large, and with flowers.

They don’t much care that it is a hood,
that is barely hanging on over their head.

Cats live in the moment,
but remember forever.

A moment or two in a beautiful headdress,
is a lifetime memory.

That they are sure to ponder,
during their long lazy afternoons.

But before you get to the headdress,
you must, you absolutely must.

Fit them with a whimsical and beautiful wig,
cats, freaking love wigs.

That is the first thing they pay attention to,
when they look at hoomans.

They see that all the fur,
has migrated to the top of they head.

And they absolutely,
become enchanted with it.

Your kitty cats bedroom,
should definitely have a series of wigs.

And you should carefully pay attention,
which they care to pose in for the day.

---

Mirrors are sometimes confusing,
but photos, even on a computer screen are not.

After a while of the picture being on display,
your kitty will totally figure out it is them.

They’ll be like: “C'est moi! Oh, la, la! Très bien Prrrrrr”,
and then take a looong and beautiful nap.

---

You see it makes sense,
to launch cat fashion shows.

Do a neat little photo-shoot,
and get those photos printed out on glossy paper.

You can often find print machines,
at your local supermarket, at something like c30 per photo.

Frame, or hang them up around your house,
it will cheer your kitten up immensely.

---

They just want to be like you,
don’t get mad at your kitty when they hop on a table.

Or take over the mouse, or keyboard,
it is a great achievement for them.

They are just trying to do things,
that you are doing.

If anything that means,
they are ready for another [fashion show](https://youtu.be/cqOxWl0WWRk).

After all,
they don’t call it a cat walk for nothing.
