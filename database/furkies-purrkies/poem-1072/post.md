Of all the birds there is one,
that truly cannot be outdone.

They are by far the most magnificent,
and surely the most intelligent.

Their song,
is piercing motivational and strong.

Not only is their vision top notch,
they love to people-watch.

And hey are so well dressed,
that their beauty, simply, cannot be suppressed.

They can fly around the equator in just 55 days,
they never fail to amaze.

Their menu, oh my gosh,
can only be defined as supremely posh!

They eat crustaceans and gastropods,
for a bird, that’s a snack of gods.

Followed by mollusks, plankton and krill,
which often makes them cheerfully trill.

A menu so sophisticated, it’s absurd,
especially for a bird.

They are the noble heralds of spring,
and it is only ever good news, they bring.

They have class, creativity, and strength,
and will stand-up for their kind at any length.

Ancient Greeks used to worship them,
sometimes they made philosophers feel dumb.

They truly are a gem,
and we should build more street lamps for them.

They are, of course, the white spotted seagull,
the one royalty that should freaking rule.

Therefore, perk up your ear,
and make sure that you can hear.

Because when you hear that cute Seagull song,
it means Summer will be here, before long.
