Just Dancing; Or, A Simple And Friendly Formula For Staying Young
Friday • August 4th 2023 • 11:17:48 pm

Dancing is one of the easiest and most natural things in the world,
we each independently re-invent it, in one way or another, when we are little.

But there is more to dancing than hopping around,
we don’t exactly move to the beats of a song, but rather…

It is the beats of the song,
that actually move our body.

So as song as the music is fresh and pretty,
and the drums behind the beat speak just the right way.

Our body just wants to move to the beat,
that gives us an incredible advantage during a workout.

---

So as song as the fresh music keeps coming,
and just at the right beats per minute.

Ones that agree,
with out body shape, perhaps dumbbells, and endurance and ability…

We will naturally move a little bit longer,
than our body would ordinary allow us without synchronizing our motion with the beat.

---

Going a little bit longer,
is the formula for increasing strength and endurance.

By increasing our endurance,
we will be sending a strong signal to our bodies to catch up.

And that will means, burning up fat, putting on muscle,
and becoming more flexible and much stronger.

Becoming more athletic,
is the closes thing there is to a formula for a long life in a body that doesn’t quite age.

When we allow ourselves to stay fit, without overdoing it,
the aches and pains that start in our Couch Potato Thirties, go away.

All of this is just a function of moving to a neat beat,
or dancing.

I think dancing is a gift,
that in the haste for maturity, we all too easily part with.

But if we turn back to it, and make it part of our life again,
it will restore us and undo decades of aging.
