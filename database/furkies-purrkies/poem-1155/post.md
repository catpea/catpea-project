Ineffective education is a symptom,
it’s root cause is uneducated pretenders in leadership positions.

Lying always ends in economic collapse,
that is then swept under the rug by war with the aim to reboot the economy.

Normally, pretenders do as little as possible,
so they can get away with taking as much as they can.

But overtime, they slowly forget that they rose to their positions,
through generational wealth and a fake it until you make it mindset.

And they start believing, that they really are leaders,
as they watch themselves age…

And slip into depression knowing deep down,
everything they’ve done was inauthentic, and meaningless to them.

The good doctor comes about, they receive stimulants for energy,
antidepressants to cancel their negative thinking, and some feel good drug.

It works for weeks maybe months, but there is no such thing,
as just turning off negative thinking.

We don’t know how these drugs really work,
and they are only tested for 90 days.

But they rarely just turn one thing off,
in fact, one researcher, says they also turn compassion off.

When the drugs wear off, the more insane leaders,
discover they are in war.

If they admit, it was just medication, they will be destroyed,
if they continue what is just another charade, they get to live some more.

Human beings do not start wars,
unless they had their humanity turned off.

Whatever wars are headed our way,
are a result of aging old pretenders, on their last desperate twitch.

There are no good reasons for war,
it is always a mistake, made by broken old men who spent their lives lying.

Only you, and all your peers can break this wrenched cycle,
and the first step towards a safer future, is authentic education.

The idea pf public education for all is new,
we still don’t know exactly what education is.

But you can be sure, that when you cram before an exam,
you were manipulated under layers of threats, to pretend to learn.

Pretending to learn, can only result is generations of small minded men,
who won’t even know that war is evil.

By pretending to learn,
you play into the economic collapse…

Mistakenly created by false leaders,
who paid their way into a leadership fantasies…

With money they’ve inherited,
and luck and odds they purchased.

While we don’t have a full picture what real and effective education is,
we know of paths that work.

That help children grow all the way up,
until they become great beings and authentic leaders.

These baths are not obvious,
the one I am about to show you will sound strange, optional, hard.

But your opinion of it, has been shaped by invective education,
you have been indoctrinated into waiting…

You have been convinced, that the grades the teacher used to cover their a**,
somehow define your level of intelligence, and maybe even value to the world.

You and every other Human Being belongs to a singe family,
and we are each capable of genius, brilliance, and infinite creativity.

The path is self directed, self paced, self education,
towards slowly becoming a computer programmer…

Capable of launching a series of small companies,
and thus rising out of poverty.

This is not one of many paths,
this maybe just the only effective path that we know of.

You can do this on your own, without massive loans,
or even upfront investment.

This is a path towards gaining the ability to tell effective education,
from ineffective education.

It is a path of adventure, of beautiful and life changing narrated books,
a path that leads towards intellectual independence, wisdom, and beyond.
