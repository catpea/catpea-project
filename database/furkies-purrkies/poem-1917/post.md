I had great success with AI,
but that was not the case this evening.

I asked the AI wrong, and I pushed it too hard,
and it entered the weird zone.

I fixed everything to perfection,
except for what appears to be a logical problem.

I want to interact with a web page that has been minimized,
outside of it self, in the area created around it.

This is standard procedure for graphical elements,
they are allowed to overflow.

But a web page within a web page,
is just that, it cannot overflow outside of it self.

Now, I have already established a communication path,
between the containing web page, and the miniature.

And the solution is to keep the miniature at coordinates 0,0,
but make its width, the same as the big page that it is in.

So the content inside will still look tiny, or big,
this is a zooming system I am working on.

But the miniature, will cover the entirety,
of the normal web page that it is embedded in.

I also have a panning system in place,
but instead of panning the miniature, by setting its x and y.

I now have to move things inside it,
which is not a challenge.

---

I originally left it up to the AI to take care of this,
but I did give it too many instructions and it failed.

Asking for something that cannot be correctly implemented,
will not magically create a solution, unfortunately.

The AI did create enough code to finish everything,
just not in one afternoon.

---

Finally, even with small delays,
the world of programming is now completely changed.

The AI writes correctly,
it shaves off the many hours of building a road testing.

Leaving just the couple, of walking down the twisty little passages,
to navigate security and complexity to find a way to the solution.

AI will suggest the paths correctly,
but does not appear to stitch them together yet.

My emphasis on code readability,
is interfering with AI being able to finish the program in one go.

But when I understood that I need to tap into the miniature,
and control it inside out.

I asked it about related techniques,
and it made the same suggestion.

If you stand in AI path of generating code to completion,
it may not finish, so you have to be ready to find your own way forward.

So, programming is not going away anywhere,
AI only eliminates the typing, you still need to be the architect.
