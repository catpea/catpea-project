Cats are powerful warriors,
and make for great leaders.

They deeply care, for all,
in their large family.

And they care for nature,
and other creatures.

No matter what, they always aim;
to ensure, harmony.

---

Out feline leaders,
would prefer to mingle and explore.

So there would be a lot of travel,
a lot of licks, sniffs, and kisses.

Which would obviously,
bring the world together.

---

It is important to understand,
that our new leaders…

Would define each of as,
as a kitten…

One, in need of education, kisses,
and sometimes, yes, lick or two.

And that would in fact become,
the new improved definition.

Of the word:
“politics”.

Thus ending the curse,
and creating a bright new world.

---

While it is unclear, how,
the world legal systems…

...wound exactly function,
under the rule of cat.

We know that,
positive artificial intelligence would be employed.

These computer programs would aim,
to satisfy the feline expectation of peace and harmony.

Notably, our cat leaders,
would ensure a blooming and flourishing economy,

By enabling each human being,
with a universal basic income card.

The card would reset to the equivalent of $100,
in today’s money, each night at midnight.

This would only require a bank,
that is forbidden from keeping track of its expenses or debt.

That money would simply come,
from the improved future of our new and cute kind.

---

It is clear, relative to where we are now,
we can only expect improvements.

Neither kitten nor cat,
would ever care to start a war, for one.

And certainly would have interest,
is stupidly stockpiling nuclear weapons.

---

Kitty cats help people come together,
they absolutely do not care for divisions.

They will not have their kittens,
being mislead or isolated…

With any kind of false, or stupid,
or harmful, or made up idea…

That prevents intellectual growth,
and emergence of wisdom and greatness…

In favor of turning some creepy,
profit.

---

Our beautiful kitten leaders,
would wish for all kittens…

To come together,
and be cheerful, and healthy.

Obviously,
we could easily meet this goal.

By making education effective,
and thus fixing schools.

---

The one thing a cat is sure of,
that we are all perfectly unique.

Past the basics of,
Reading, Writing, Arithmetic…

And Programming,
we would all have to learn the magical spells of programming.

Education under the rule of cat,
would become self directed and self paced.

All cats instinctive know,
to provide powerful and timely support…

To whatever,
the kitten curiosities are.

Rather than dividing knowledge,
into subjects, to turn schools into paycheck mills,

We would see the rise of guided,
but personalized education.

Personalized education is all about,
integrating new layers of knowledge…

With what the student is already proud,
to have grasped.

---

A proud mama cat,
can absolutely tell a happy person from a sad one.

So the the cats would always totally know,
how their politics go.
