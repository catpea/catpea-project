Authentic Self Education; Or, Advancing Human Kind Today
Friday • May 13th 2022 • 5:25:23 pm

"The only thing you have to fear is fear it self",\
holds true for growing all the way up.

Like the power of endurance,\
which just takes a couple of years.

And demand that we **gradually** increase,\
the workout load and complexity.

We have many superpowers,\
stored behind some impossible to skip things.

In a word,\
only the worthy.

In fact there are superpowers,\
we shouldn't just speak of in passing.

Just out of respect for those,\
who used them to overcome human cruelty and rise above it.

---

Helping you understand what that means,\
is noble enough to yet again call upon Dr. Frankl.

"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.\
They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:\
the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."

We can invent Philosophies and even Fantasies as the cases is with religion,\
to shield our minds and grant us ten minutes more to no end.

No such thing can be conjured up at the snap of fingers,\
like in superhero movies.

Like with endurance workouts,\
it is a result of some challenging sum of.

When Dr. Frankl states that Success will ensue,\
that also holds true for superpowers, they ensue from the choices we make.

"For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue,\
and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself\
or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.\
Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it."

Such is the case with Genius,\
we are not just capable of it, we are pre-disposed for it.

But there is a requirement,\
a series of pursuits, that eventually, add to become more than the mere sum the parts.

Genius is born from having explored so many things,\
that they create a body of knowledge, that we can apply by subtle analogy, to problems we have never encountered before.

---

It is important,\
that we define our terms at this point.

Genius is not a positive word,\
it a a narr...

...e will not grow up.

In which case Humanity will fail to advance,\
and will [continue repeating the same mistakes in a MAD circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7ljlMS_cLQ).

Our culture is missing an important component,\
the tradition of parents asking their children to grow all the way up until they become wise and great beings.

Because of the continued nuclear thereat of uneducated leaders stockpiling world destroying weapons,\
we all have grew up under the threat of Mutually Assured Destruction.

In that way,\
the houses that we have built are houses of cards.

Rather than pursuit of career and paycheck,\
by means of hoop jumping ineffective education.

We must rise to stand in relentless pursuit of greatness,\
that is the only way that humanity can advance.

Until then, Humanity **will be** locked in a circle,\
repeating its mistakes.

---

All it takes is preventing fear,\
from interfering with us, growing all the way up.

Don't be scared of the uncertainty,\
that comes from continued authentic self education.

Do not tolerate ineffective education,\
if you are not learning in school, take to self education.

The modern age gives you the opportunity,\
to listen to all the books that you need to continue growing all the way up - it has never been easier.

---

Do not feed the profiteering gluttons behind college loans,\
and actors and celebrity politicians; exactly what they want you to give them.

Do not build a house of cards,\
under the threat of Mutually Assured Destruction.

Rise and take to wisdom initializing a culture of growing all the way up in Dignity and Authenticity,\
to your family, and the future of younger generations.

Let us advance our culture today,\
as there are far too many threats in not too distant future.

This poem begun with "The only thing you have to fear is fear it self",\
explaining that authentic wisdom is better than inauthentic education and careers likely to have negative impact on mental health.

Let us end by paraphrasing another president,\
"Our problems are human-made, therefore they can be easily solved by humans."

Let us use our predisposition for Wisdom and Greatness to undo our mistakes,\
and grant the younger generations, a bright future - without a worry in sight.
