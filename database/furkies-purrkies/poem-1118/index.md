She came to visit once or twice,
and thought the peanuts were a nice surprise.

Though she hated bits of cheddar cheese,
couldn't even stand the downwind breeze.

She came and pondered why with Squirrels share,
she seemed to think it was quite rare.

But I think of Squirrels as great warrior creatures,
and they centrality make amazing teachers.

One morning I saw two Powerful Warrior Crows,
fiercely fighting a hawk with an evil nose.

The two chased the villain away,
across the entire driveway.

The crows are legendary too,
they were wise warriors through and through.

---

But hours later, I saw the hawk on the ground,
and the battle field was silent, not a single sound.

I slammed my door, to startle the hawk,
and Wobbles resumed fighting as hard as a rock.

The hawk tried to carry her anyway,
but within seconds she twisted out and got away.

I saw her land safely on the ground,
and dart into the woods like lightening without a sound.

I haven’t seen her stuff her silly cheeks,
in several long weeks.

But I wasn’t worried, she is a greater warrior than I am,
and war is clearly her peanut butter jam.

She finally returned today all proud and mighty,
and as always her mood was cheerful and fighty.

She was first to find all the peanuts I shared,
and not for a second did she get sacred.
