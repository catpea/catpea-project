For I Am A Mighty Cat
Friday • January 6th 2023 • 9:27:34 pm

I sleep all day, hunt all night,
I am a mighty cat alright.

---

Coyotes fear me throughout the land,
it just takes one swipe with my mighty hand.

I give angry Bears,
the worst nightmares.

No monster that finds life dear,
will ever come near.

I am a damn mighty feline,
I make every creature take the beeline.

---

I am a cat, a darn mighty cat,
and I can catch a rat just like that.

I am a hard lifting cat,
haven't got an ounce of fat,

I once snagged a flying bat,
I got him good, for I am a cat.

---

I dance, at every chance.
meowing at every circumstance.

I like to get to bed,
and make some bread.

For I have a need,
I have a need to knead.

And I ain’t no amateur,
when times comes to purr.

---

My favorite dish,
is baked fish.

My mamma bakes it,
and when she ain’t lookin, I takes it.

I am a mighty cat,
and there ain’t no other like that.
