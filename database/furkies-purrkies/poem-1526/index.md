Vacations end, and vacationers go home,
they don’t know what a grave mistake that is.

And the adventurer never returns,
and their adventure is not about conquering.

The adventure,
is always about the adventurer.

---

There are questions to be answered,
because an un-examined life is, dangerous.

This is why an adventurer,
never returns, there is nothing to go back to.

Unlike vacations,
that can keep a person within a lie, or invisible walls.

An adventure, is a sacred quest for truth,
there is only forward.

---

If you expand your vacation,
to an excess that you have never imagined.

If you can withstand,
the mistaken feeling of regret.

If you can hand on,
ten days more.

Then you will precipitate out of the solution,
to other people’s problems.

And as the world regains its true colors,
you will experience your hollowness.

Or hunger, or the ravenous need,
for not just some brainless novel.

But books, written by clear thinking non-religious beings,
that will help you make your way in the universe.

---

If you stay in wonderland,
you will never feel an urge for wisdom.

If you just keep going forward
you will find yourself…

In the narrated books section,
of the nearest library.

Searching for tools and gifts from other adventurers,
that never went back.

---

Vacation is your way towards health,
but it is also the tragedy of most.

Because it erases just enough discomfort,
not to complain, and go back for another rat race.

So close, to a better world,
a more educated humanity.

A brighter future,
and so good at cutting a mind back.

---

“I have to get back on Monday, yeah”,
“apparently there is a pile of folders in my inbox”

“We’ll have to come back again next year”,
“I am worried about his diabetes.”

“No, it is expensive out here”,
“but we visit every year.”

“No, we have to pack,
you have to dry your tent. Stop it!”

---

The proximity between vacation and bondage,
and adventure and greatness, is terrifying.

Illnesses born of an unhealthy lifestyle,
mental health problems, all can be prevented.

---

If you just keep sitting in that chair,
until you lose your job, end your career…

And all the inauthentic horsedung,
will stop sucking you dry.

It is my sincere hope,
that if you hang on to your questions.

And just expect the waves of doubt,
and let them keep passing through you.

As you sit there, a day longer,
three days longer, a week longer.

An extra months,
and become poorer an poorer.

You will begin seeing that the doubt,
is just the toxicity that was driven into you.

It is the thing that has filled your vessel,
and in its absence.

A spark will rekindle your flame,
and snap you into a library.

Where clear thinking great beings,
can guide you.

Get to the adventure books first,
please understand, that authentic adventure books are not about adventure.

Then as you begin to build your self up,
some synthetic stories can inspire you.

But keep going, towards philosophy books,
because that is where your intellectual inheritance resides.

Travel the Triple Crown,
The Application Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide trails.

As they will enhance your appetite for knowledge,
you will being searching for greater and greater ideas.

---

And then, a day will come,
where you will no longer be able to find your next book.

He authors will feel hollow,
despite their greatness.

That is where you begin,
that is where your book becomes one more step.

On the path that you are traveling,
that others have built up for you.

That you must now build up,
for others that are sure to follow.

---

This is the path of your greatness,
this is the path where you can finally grow all the way up.

All the way,
until you too leave your mark as a great being.

…

Begin planning your vacation,
with one strange little detail…

No return reservation,
just a one way ticket.

Hang on tight, those first free days,
where you overstay, and the office keeps calling, are the hardest.

Don’t go back, resist it, it is not your life,
it is not for you, you don’t have your wisdom yet.

And you deserve to grow all the way up,
don’t go back, don’t go back; go forward.

Find your books, find the authors that think the way you do,
your mind and body will flourish.

You are not a worker, you are not part of the team,
your office is not a real family, they are understaffed.

Meet your elder self, and ask them,
if they want you to become a great being.

Ask therm about their regrets,
about whether they wished to learn from great beings, or small ones.

You are not a worker, hang on for ten more days,
don’t go back, go outside what you know.

---

Every day, will then become a story worth reading,
an authentic quest for knowledge wisdom and greatness.

Maybe you’ll learn programming from AI,
you can ask ad-hoc questions and tailor your education.

Maybe, you’ll become that one person,
that everyone goes to for their triple crown amulet.

AT, PCT, CDT, a gateway out,
the noblest, the hardest, but so worthy of the true you.

You are not a worker,
not a solution to other peoples problems.

You are meant to grow all the way up,
and become a great being.

The world needs change,
the world needs the greater you.
