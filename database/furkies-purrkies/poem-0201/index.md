There was a little lady that figured out how to change the world,

all that is known, is that she wasn't very old.

She posted a single long video, that opened with "I don't want to be a bother,"

today, everyone just calls her, Mum or Mother.

---

She said that Democracies require educated voters to operate,

that without real education a Democracy can fill with hate.

"A democratic majority consensus is a really big deal,

without a consensus a nation will always suffer and never heal."

She spoke of the blight of Fake Education,

she said it lasted long enough to bring her nation down into great desperation.

---

She said Politics were as fake as Education,

"everyone role-playing and quite blind to the real needs of the nation"

---

The video was several hours long,

it showed her computer programs and how they brought the world together to get along.

She showed how Nations can invest into the futures of their kids,

creating educational paths with rewards and bids.

Game companies inspired by her imagination,

built it all, her entire virtual nation.

Slowly one by one, cities around the word adopted her program,

to this day it is still true to the original diagram.

---

Today, marks the programs 500th release,

and we celebrate 500 hundred years of Her Wisdom and World Peace.
