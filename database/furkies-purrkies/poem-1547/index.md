To progresses in life,
you must use that which is inexhaustible within you.

On top of all the wisdom you can inherit,
from life changing books that produce real results.

And you will have to walk your path, authentically,
because ultimately that is where your achievement lies.

---

Everyone from parents, teachers and guidance counselors onward,
to politicians and prime ministers and presidents, will be confidently wrong.

In my programming, I've long abandoned languages,
that most programmers encourage to today.

They aren't wrong because I chose a different path,
but because their paths won't go as far as mine.

They'll spend ages reinventing frameworks and technologies,
abundant in a more popular and effective language.

In my recent argument about body building,
I had no fear of losing, because I also traveled what I said.

I can see thousands of little eddies of complexity,
and a narrowing path from jogging to bodybuilding.

Hopefully without sounding stuffy,
I drew analogies to music, to adventure.

Away from synthetic either/or models,
towards the human condition.

A workout is not just about fitness,
but the well being of the mind.

There is not enough life,
or time in the universe, for that matter…

To execute mindless routines,
like some terrible punch card computer.

---

We are works of art,
not machine-like automatons.

As much as doctors,
would like to convince you.

That all you are is dopamine, serotonin,
oxytocin and endorphins.

That MRI can image your thoughts,
before you have them.

Or as per my recent argument,
that it is either anabolic or catabolic.

You are more, with passions and curiosities,
and also infinitely unique, irreplaceable.

Given that it is even possible to bodybuild,
the textbook way without a crooked doctor.

In general synthetic advice is wrong,
because scientific models require re-hydration.

They must be put back,
into real life.

Student quoting a textbook,
thinking that it is an easy way to win an argument.

Is merely good entertainment,
that ultimately has no bearing on reality.

---

You do get a thicker skin as you age,
as you gain more experience.

As you learn how impossible,
the synthetic models become.

How they push people away,
from their goals.

Standardized education can’t work,
only curiosity driven personalized instruction will.

The aim of a human being is not to be a worker,
but to grow all the way up and become a great being.

Greatness changes lives for better,
small mindedness makes life miserable.

---

We fall into loops and traps,
on larger scale that can mean war.

On a personal scale, failure to become fit,
and giving up 40 years of life, due to obesity and overwork.

---

While there are no perfect books,
if you read or listen to enough of them.

And make enough room,
by taking to months long adventure.

You will begin inheriting,
the wisdom that fits you from countless lives of thinkers and dreamers.

That will take you far,
but ultimately, and you know it.

You got to go up into the arena,
that is right, you will need your triumphs and failures.

---

Before I let Mr. Roosevelt close,
I want to repeat.

That most people you meet,
will not give you correct advice.

Because, they have not lived,
through most things.

Listen carefully,
consider whatever wisdom there may be.

But follow your own curiosity,
and passion.

Because what calls to you,
is the strongest force there is.

And it will support you,
when all else has given, or became lost.

---

What is in you will help you survive,
muddy trenches, homelessness, and tragedy.

And fitness or ultra-marathons,
even if you start way in the minus as a gorgeous fatty.

You will need the power,
of your curiosity, and passion.

Because you will need to do the walking,
and that will take more than what you have.

It will take those thing in you,
that never run out, that keep on giving.

Like Theodore Roosevelt said ‘It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds;

who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
