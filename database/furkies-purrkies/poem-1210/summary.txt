Integrity And Integration
Saturday • June 24th 2023 • 11:08:10 pm

There is magic to life,
a unique unmatched magnificence to each person.

But, there are no mysterious puzzles in life,
everything is exactly as it is.

The made up things are fantasy,
and the ones that matter are tough.

If a teacher is not teaching,
they are a fraud.

If schools are ineffective,
they don’t work.

Past the point of prevention,
trouble bursts into anomalies.

Try as hard as you can,
but you can’t unmix a cup of coffee.

The difficult things,
need to be divided to be grasped.

But subject divisions,
turn education into a circus.

---

Education is really,
that prevention point.

When we fail the students,
we can’t unmix the trouble.

They go on to become adults,
but not grown ups.

We have to fix schools,
before getting to the rest.

We have to give people safety,
before they take to reading a book.

There can be no safety,
on a poverty planet.

But there will be,
no consensus.

No universal basic income,
without education.

---

This part is for the rebels,
those who question status quo.

Who are unafraid,
of all the yelling twats.

Inflation, markets, are man made,
but in the hands of noise.

For a better future,
we must now use a damn computer.

---

Where these rebels are,
nobody knows.

Maybe a century or two,
in the future.

---

But one morning someone like you  will wake up,
with a UBI card.

Grab a Danish,
A Supersized Vendi Coca Mocha.

And take off to walk the trails,
and write in their journals.

They will never go hungry,
and listen to 10,000 books.

And probably just turn right around,
and white a couple of dozen, on their way back

---

Education of the future,
is a single thread.

Initially it starts with,
multiple curiosities.

But they weave together,
and form an ever thicker thread.

No dots, no lines, no webs,
just wisdom at break neck speeds.

---

And that,
is how growing up starts.

A card with just enough,
to not go hungry or homeless.

And a path of adventure,
with more books to shake a stick at.

---

This enlightening brilliant part,
is the hardest to see.

Because,
it is so unusual.

Knowledge and adventure,
somehow becomes wisdom.

And wisdom, begins growing,
towards greatness.

This is just growing up,
that is all it is.

We don’t grow into a bubble,
by knowledge and experience.

We burst through bubbles,
and invisible walls…

By means of constant transcendence,
of limits.

Growing up is a perpetual rise,
there is no stopping part way.

It is so fitting, so enormously human,
that growing all the way up.

Would be even more magnificent,
than love of wisdom.
