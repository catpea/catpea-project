It is a known fact that all creature of the stars,
have a purrculator and can purr as loud as cars.

(Purr, lol)

I you can purr like this,
than you should also know about your duties.

---

Scientists have long known,
that not all adults are fully grown.

If you passed the test,
especially with a measure of zest.

That that is even more true,
for the now even more magnificent you.

---

From now on you must never think small.
And grow to become intellectually tall.

Unlike ordinary people who believe they know it all,
self education, is your first goal.

You must always remember that memorization is a trap.
And relentlessly aim to grow all the way up.

Get curious about programming and code,
and you will never run out of road.

Yes, your knowledge must be vast,
but also becoming an athlete is now a must.

Adventure is where most creatures of the stars belong,
as the starry skies are their mother and song.

---

Aim to live long and rebelliously,
working towards a beautiful legacy.

View fake education as a blight,
and aim to set things right.

But also take good care of your mind,
never falling behind.

---

Every creature of the stars has an internal map,
that they can easily pull up.

It is all your nobles curiosities,
and they are your most important qualities.

As that is where your real education starts,
this is where you get your smarts.

All you have to do learn,
is just follow them.
