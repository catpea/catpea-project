It has somehow snuck up on us,
that if we just wait for Wednesdays…

We can get to the weekend,
faster.

This has become a common cure,
for the case of Mondays.

But this daring cure,
unfortunately comes with a side effect.

And the side effect,
is death.

By throwing away time,
by tuning thighs out.

And by getting good at it,
life will instantly pass you by.

---

We arise from chaos,
to be plucked…

From a perfect,
and calm silence.

And then upon our time,
we are gently returned to it…

Never, ever,
to be plucked again.

---

It is a rule of the Universe,
to love life, to love each day.

It is forbidden,
to merely pass time.

And both the elder you,
and you on your final day.

Will call you stupid,
and hate your guts for doing so.

There no greater regret,
then throwing your time away.

For the universe time is cheap,
but for the human…

To say that it is priceless,
is a serious understatement.

---

Therefore,
if you have ever tied to pass a week…

The elder, and eldest you,
has a message for you.

It is not a very pretty message,
so you may want to sit down, for this one.

---

“Listen here...
your immense arrogance, and disrespect for precious time.

Has robbed us of multiple decades,
and now, there is nothing but regret and old age.

Your overwork, and overeating, and passing of time,
along with zeal for weekends is your single dumbest idea.

It is so dumb, that life as you know it,
is done – you are not going to work tomorrow.

And don’t you dare,
don’t you dare, disobey your wisest self.

I, as your elder self, order you,
to go to the nearest store, right now.

And get a backpack and a tent,
and begin preparing for walking the Appalachian Trail.

It is the only way, you will make room for the intellectual inheritance,
that has been denied to you to turn you into a worker.

You will get you hands on all the narrated non fiction,
that is held in high regard by all the worlds intellectuals.

And you will listen to the books,
as you walk the trail.

---

If you fail yourself now,
and disobey this order.

The next thing you’ll know,
is that it is too late.

As you will have become me,
writing this very letter, to you...

In hopes of reconnecting,
with who you once were – so don’t.

---

Go get the backpack,
go get the tent.

There are no more ordinary days ahead of you,
you are now charged with growing all the way up.”
