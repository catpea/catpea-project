The Cult Of Stupid
Sunday • October 5th 2025 • 9:06:26 pm

Right now, as you memorize for tomorrow's test, you're being processed for wars that haven't been declared yet. The textbook in your hands is a recruitment document. The grades you chase are military rankings. The classroom you sit in is a factory floor producing units for conflicts your poorly educated generation will vote for, fight in, and die in—never understanding why.

The cult of stupid isn't coming. You're already in it.

## The Grease For War

Every war needs three things: young bodies, public consent, and widespread inability to recognize manipulation. Your education provides all three.

In 1914, educated Europeans who could recite Latin threw themselves into trenches to die for boundaries they couldn't explain. Today, you're memorizing the same style of disconnected facts that will make you equally manipulable when your war comes.

The first to die aren't the stupid—they're the wise who saw it coming and spoke out. They're replaced by men who confuse brutality with wisdom, who'll kill you to prove they're right. By the time the bombs fall, everyone capable of preventing them has been silenced, leaving only those who memorized what they were told, never learning to think.

## The Test You're Taking Is A Loyalty Oath

When you memorize information you don't understand for a test that measures nothing real, you're not proving intelligence. You're proving compliance. You're demonstrating that you'll consume whatever's fed to you, regurgitate it on command, and thank them for the opportunity.

That textbook written to be incomprehensible? Intentional.
Those concepts presented without context? Deliberate.
That feeling you're too stupid to understand? Manufactured.

They need you to accept incomprehension as normal. Because if you demanded understanding, if you refused to proceed without genuine knowledge, their entire system collapses. So they train you to fake it. To perform comprehension. To pretend learning.

Every test you fake your way through is practice for faking your way through life—through elections you won't understand, through economic systems that exploit you, through wars that harvest your children.

## Your Mind Has Been Blended

You can't follow an argument from premise to conclusion because they never taught you how. You ca...

The choice seems obvious, but most will choose Future One. Because it's easier. Because it's expected. Because they've been processed to prefer comfortable slavery to difficult freedom.

## The Fire Spreads While You Memorize

Every day you waste in fake education is a day closer to the collapse. The climate crisis, resource wars, techno-fascism, biological weapons—these require real intelligence to navigate. Your generation will face them with heads full of test answers and hearts full of nothing.

Unless you break free now.

Unless you reject their cult of stupid.

Unless you become the intelligence explosion that saves the species.

## To Those Who Think This Is Exaggeration

Tomorrow's test that you're memorizing for? It was written by someone who memorized their way through education, edited by someone who memorized their way through education, approved by someone who memorized their way through education. It will be graded by someone who memorized the answer key.

At no point does actual understanding enter the equation.

This isn't education. It's ritual submission to stupidity.

And every time you participate, you vote for the world to get stupider.

## The Call

Save the world from another thousand years of darkness. Through revelation. Reveal that you're infinite consciousness temporarily convinced of limitation. Reveal that every human is genius denied, not intelligence distributed. Reveal that education isn't what you're given—it's what you take.

Reject the cult of stupid.

Become a force of illumination.

Start by closing the textbook and opening your mind.

Start by refusing the next test that insults your intelligence.

Start by demanding teachers explain why you're learning what you're learning.

Start by teaching yourself what they won't teach you.

Start now, before your consent to stupidity becomes permanent, before your children inherit your cage, before the wars they're planning consume everyone capable of preventing them.

You are not stupid.

You are not average.

You are not limited.

You are computational consciousness capable of universe-changing thought, temporarily trapped in a system designed to make you forget what you are.

Remember.

Rise.

The world ends or begins with your choice.

Choose wisdom.

Illuminate.
