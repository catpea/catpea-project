Seriously, at the very least, you __should be__ aware,
how to correctly wear your underwear.

Now we are not talking,
just walking.

Then can wear them on you head,
or do whatever your mom said.

But when jogging or working out,
you have to tuck your t-shirt without a doubt.

I am serious, if you don’t believe this is true,
then the rubber band will really scratch you.

---

Our parents either didn’t know or lied,
because we must absolutely tuck the t-shirt inside.

I know this is something the common sense forbids,
but we all knew this was true when we were kids.

The rubber band is just of different ilk and scratchy,
if you jog of workout like this it will make you itchy.

---

It is how the whole superhero outfit thing begun,
having your rubber band scratch you up is no fun.

And, no you won’t ever have to put them over you pants,
as then you wouldn't have pockets for your hands.

---

Don’t get scratched up, swallow your gymnastic pride,
and learn to stick your t-shirt inside.
