I am certain, that any two step process on your computer,
can not only be swiftly automated.

But desperately calls for a custom visual programming language,
actions that you connect with wires.

I have created many visual programming languages,
and I can assure you it does not matter where you start.

You can do something like Apple Automator,
or Blender Geometry Nodes / ComfyUI.

The code for it, is not the code the AI writes,
but the text that describes your needs.

And I recommend, you always remind AI,
to update your program requirements as you create new clones.

---

If you ever discover a new patter, like I did recently,
you put aside your old texts, and begin writing new requirements.

My discovery has the AI creating XML documents,
that describe application structure.

And my punchline is that, every XML node/tag,
is an actual web component in my web page.

So my XML document that represents application state,
is actually an HTML application state.

But its most valuable feature is clarity,
the XML triples as the system diagram.

And AI and I focus on keeping that perfect,
the nearly 4,000 lines of code the AI has written thus far.

Is just implementation, functionality, it is AI managed,
and even more importantly, it is not liability, it is needed.

It is needed for a single and clear purpose,
make the web components XML describes come to life.

---

To give you a little overview of my process,
just so you know where the start is.

I simply asked my AI to describe a visual programming language
with features that I understand and like.

And [save that as a requirements document][0],
and then asked it to break it down into implementation stages.

(I include the original 4000 line document,
in the original version of text.)

---

AI is amazing at programming, it has trouble seeing user interfaces,
that is where it will need your eyes.

But you just tell it what is broken,
and it will track it down in code.

---

Now,
let me close by explaining the value of this beast.

Once you look at some Blender Geometry Nodes and ComfyUI tutorials,
you will totally grasp how visual programming works.

It is just ports and wires,
and the function that you tie together.

But, the true value is in you selling a commercial license,
or premium access to some build of your sustem.

And you can [see an example of moneymaking in rete.js][1],
when you go to their documentation.

Some very important code examples are locked behind a pro tag,
and while it is annoying, after a while it makes sense.

And that is just on the library end,
beyond this are web apps you create.

And here you do [ask for a monthly membership][2],
for premium hosting and features, exactly the way comfy does.

---

It is a wonderful thing to sit down to programming,
before you know much about it.
