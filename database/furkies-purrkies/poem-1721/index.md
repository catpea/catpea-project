You biggest problem is listening to everyone else,
and doing exactly what they tell you to do.

Eventually you figure out that people want you to become more convenient,
and teachers couldn't care less about your education.

If you follow their directions, your mind will become scattered,
all your thoughts and questions will be looping right around.

By following directions, you are not in charge of yourself,
and instead of growing up, you will just age to become bitter, and pretty crazy.

What you need to do, is begin assembling yourself, in spite of poverty,
in spite of bondage, and in spite of ridicule, and yelling, and being a cast away.

---

Life will never be easy, challenges will always arise,
and you will need yourself, as not to implode all the time.

---

You begin with just a couple of pages if a journal,
you can just imagine them.

What are you protecting, what do you care about,
what of the machinery of the world calls to you?

It is hard at first, as you know little,
but things like Philosophers, Powerful Poems, maybe Hiking, or Appalachian Trail...

Or even 3D Modeling and Printing, maybe Programming,
or painting with the use of a wall projector, or even making AI Music Albums…

Will gently stick out,
and that is your first step.

The same things will continue calling to you,
throughout your entire existence.

Often transformed, by what you have learned on top of them,
but fundamentally, the same.

And each time you circle around,
revisiting what call to you.

Not only do you learn more,
but bring more, of what you have learned from your other curiosities.

And layer by layer you build,
and no one must push you away from who you are.

When teachers tell you what to learn and in what sequence, and when,
or parents tell you who you need to become, they are endangering your mind.

If they manage to threaten you sufficiently so,
and collapse your cycle of curiosities, you will not rise, you will scatter..

---

People forget to learn, they aren’t reminded of their intellectual inheritance,
in the shape of thousands of books.

That not only grant them knowledge, but alter their culture,
helping them inherit the culture of great thinkers.

---

Aside from revolving around your own curiosities,
you have to protect yourself from stress, as it too, will scatter you.

Stress comes in many forms,
bullies will try to corrupt you.

Manipulators will hope to make you feel stuck or unintelligent,
so the you listen to their advice, that will turn you into a tool.

And poverty is entirely artificial, it is not your fault,
it is made up, you have to reject it, so that it does not hold you back.

---

Often people are too far into the consequences of choices to gently work themselves out,
their exit can only be found in the Triple Crown.

A nearly two year journey, crossing the Appalachian, Pacific Crest,
and Continental Divide Trails – it is hard, painful, sometimes lonely.

But to make it to the end, people reconstitute themselves,
into who they once were, or hoped to become, they find themselves again.

---

For the rest of us, and the others who catch up, day by day, we grow in wisdom,
that is what growing up means.

Wisdom is the only sturdy building material,
capable of hoisting you up, without a threat of collapse.

Wisdom will never ask you for donations, or tolerance of crimes,
wisdom does not have a label, or a central organization with a bloody history.

It is purely a positive force of entablement and empowerment,
of strength, of courage, of unbreakability, and clarity.

---

Thus, you, fueled by knowledge, in large part inherited from great beings,
but also transformed by their culture, and touched by starry nights...

You set off on a great interstellar journey, not just as a human,
but as a creature of the starts – an undeniable fact.

To transform all your wisdom, inherited, discovered, synthesized,
with who you are, who you have grown into, by following your own path.

Into something you share:
a cheerful little legacy of wisdom and adventure.
