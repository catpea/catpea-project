Waking up at Nordhouse Dunes was nice,
sometimes it was a bit chilly, but nice.

I always has my Narrated Books playing,
and I did not feel lonesome at all.

And I would stay for obscene numbers of days,
I would camp there until I got bored.

Until I collected all the cool new rocks,
used up all the walking sticks.

Until I swam and bathed in Lake Michigan,
so many times, that I became nature.

Chipmunks would miss me,
and cheerfully whistle as I walked by.

Racons would include me in their activities,
such as meandering, and toublemaking.

Mosquitoes would literary stop biting,
and use me as a convenient way to get around.

And we all the the same idea,
drive to the to the freaking Supermarket.

I would go get Ice Cream,
the mosquitoes would get the shoppers.

Nobody knew me,
but everyone knew I was not a tourist.

I was there,
on business with the universe.

And also, to build flimsy and dangerous,
and very large, driftwood horsis.

Which impressed at least,
two tourists - at least.

In Ludington my favorite place was a little antique store
that had neatly smelling book section.

I found a beautiful and well worn,
1963 pocket version of Robinson Crusoe.

Which I already had as a narrated book on my mp3 player,
and took it as a sign, that it was time to hear the full story.

I mostly kept to the wilderness,
making sure that I had all the firewood I needed.

And that I had plenty of time,
to prepare for watching the Lake Michigan sunset.
