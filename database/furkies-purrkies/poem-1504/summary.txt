In Wisdom The World Finds Peace, And All Conflicts Cease
Sunday • April 14th 2024 • 1:02:46 am

It is a big world,
we got ourselves into.

And human beings,
are all too easily mislead.

We simply believe,
whatever we are born into.

And most times,
whatever it is, it is flawed.

We need wisdom,
as our universal language.

---

Flaws in construction of the world,
create gaps and loops.

And that,
is no way to talk.

Ideas, already, are delicate,
a sprinkle of imaginary creatures...

Will collapse them faster,
than they can grow.

Then everything turns to loops,
and humanity repeats mistakes.

---

Unlike imaginary things,
wisdom does not curl around.

It is an infinite road,
where giants upon their shoulders…

Build,
towards future.

Old philosophers set the foundations,
the new, add higher floors.

---

Despite the warnings,
we learn to grow together.

We do not... fall apart,
in tongues.

---

In reality,
there is no room for lies.

Wisdom demands,
authentic and functional knowledge.

In fantasy,
the liars always win.

---

Only in wisdom and philosophy,
can humanity will find peace.

Because only in world enlightenment,
is there no room for liars to hide.

---

Of all the things all too human,
wisdom is nearest our minds.

And wisdom and its culture,
the culture of greatness.

Calls for nature and adventure,
the loudest.

Walking great trails,
helps our minds make room.

Trails like Appalachian, Continental Divide,
and Pacific Crest, help us come of age.

They are our cradle,
and the forge for our minds.

Combined with great,
philosophical works.

We inherit the best of human cultures,
The Culture of Greatness.

---

On the trails,
thoughts weave long and clear.

The adventurers see vision of world peace,
and eventually all conflicts resolve and cease.
