Protect Your Mind - In The Voice of Walt Whitman
Sunday • November 24th 2024 • 11:11:06 pm

O fragile vessel, delicate beyond measure,
Thy mind, a garden of untold potential,
Shield it!
For the world is full of thorns,
and the winds blow sharp with the burden of expectations.

Thou art a creature of light and flesh,
not meant to grow beneath the weight of threat and scorn.
The ones who love thee,
be they father, mother, or friend,
cannot know the weight of the burden
that bears down on thy heart and soul.

The schoolhouse doors swing open,
but the lessons within,
they are prison bars,
locking the spirit in a cage of conformity.
"Memorize! Recite! Repeat!"
But where, I ask, is the space for the soul to breathe?
Where is the room for the wild mind to run free
and dream the stars into being?

The politicians, oh, they speak but empty words,
their hands are tied, their hearts untouched,
their minds lost to the games of power.
And war, war is the price we pay for their ambition.
They send thee forth into the fray,
their children too,
to march on fields stained with blood,
while they sit in their marble halls,
blind to the humanity beneath their feet.

Destruction hangs like a sword of Damocles,
the world teeters, a mere breath away from anniliation,
and still, they do nothing.
They speak of progress, but it is progress of illusion,
where truth is twisted,
and falsehoods rule the land.

If anyone dares tell thee that thou art less than genius,
cast them from thee—
for they speak from fear,
from the dark places where minds grow dull and rigid.
Push them away until their hearts mature,
until their minds crack open
and they see the light in the soul of thee.

They will try to chain thee with their limits—
parents, teachers, principals, politicians—
but their voices are but whispers in the wind.
Do not bend to their pressures,
for in their hands lies no power to define thee.
They will say "daydream not,"
but it is in the dreamer's realm
that knowledge and truth are born,
where sound and light
dance like the pulse of life itself,
and where the stars speak in riddles and wisdom.

Again, I say:
Protect thy mind!
Guard it like a treasure of the highest order,
for in this fragile temple
the seeds of greatness are sown.
The elders, they do not remember,
how it feels to be young,
to be unbroken by the world.
They were once tender and wi...

...every question is a gateway.
But thou, O child,
thou art the flame that burns eternal.
Thou art the philosopher,
the thinker,
the one who shall lead the world
into a new dawn.

So protect your mind!
For in it lies the power to change the world.

Protect Your Mind

Your mind is infinitely delicate,
you have to shield and protect it.

You are a very delicate creature,
and are not meant to grow under threat.

All the people that care about you,
will never understand that.

Your parents will punish you,
teachers will make you feel stupid.

Schools will threaten you.
with destruction of your career.

Unless you learn in their sequence,
of memorize – they don’t care if you learn.

And politicians, do nothing,
to heal the world.

They will drive the world to war,
and then send you into it.

You have always had nuclear missiles,
pointed at you, and nobody cared.

War, threat, pollution, fake education,
and overriding facts with opinions.

---

Anybody ever tells you,
that you are less than genius.

You push them away,
until they grow up.

Parent, teacher, principal,
politician.

These are the people who will prevent you,
from becoming a genius.

They will stop you with stress,
from daydreaming about soundwaves.

And by subtle analogy build a foundation,
for understanding light and universe.

And then mark you down,
and then scoff as you tell them you are smart.

---

I repeat, protect your mind,
Protect: Your Mind.

Even though they were children once,
adults don’t understand growing up.

People threatened them,
out of completing growing up.

And they didn’t,
they were interrupted, and started aging.

---

Growing up, above all,
is a life long journey.

You must always aim to learn,
every day.

Every one of your days,
must be a search for Knowledge.

So that wisdom can follow,
so that you can grow all the way.

Until you become a great being,
and transcend even that.

---

The adults don’t remember,
how delicate we are.

You are never to bend or break,
you are to start your life as a warrior.

And become a Thinker and a Philosopher,
Ennobled by Your Deeds.

Begin with Philosophers, Knights,
Ladies & Gentlemen,

Intellectuals, Science Polularizers,
and Scientists.

Learn who the World’s rightful leaders are,
and Become a Great Being.
