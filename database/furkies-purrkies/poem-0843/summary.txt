Learn To No End And Let The World Grow
Tuesday • June 21st 2022 • 2:22:40 pm

I got a fortune cookie once,\
with the following text:

"If you do the same things you've always done,\
you will get the same things you've always got"

This is trivial and almost silly when applied to an individual,\
but it becomes something else when applied to generations.

---

As laws of the Universe have it, all the bad things that are up in the air,\
will occur, unless we stand up and prevent them.

If there is **no one** to prevent Nuclear War,\
there will be nothing to stop a moron from starting one.

If you leave it up to the politicians,\
they'll impose sanctions all right, but 30 years late.

---

You see, we did the same things we've always done,\
and we got the same things we've always been getting.

Even though, war this day and age,\
is absolutely the dumbest $%#$%(@ thing in the world.

---

It still happened,\
because of the ghouls that still live in the past.

There is only one lesson to learn,\
building path through real education and towards intellectual independence.

There are too many things left unsaid, between generations,\
there isn't enough class in the universe to prevent that silence from eventually being broken.

---

Do not do things that prevent you from having,\
a happy future that is worthy of you.

It is easy not to set a foot in the bar,\
but it is not so easy to stand up for real education with real and profound results.

Without learning for real,\
we will cut ourselves off from anything between creativity all the way up to being able to afford medical care.

If all we do is get good grades without learning for real,\
then as the world becomes more entangled by repeating stupid old mistakes we will come closer and closer to extreme poverty.

Without a powerful body of knowledge built across an entire lifetime,\
one that cannot be conjured up in the last minute by cramming, we will get looped around in a mad circle.

Without real education,\
there will be nowhere to go, but straight to the beginning... of the previous century.

---

If politicians were able to help,\
you would be equipped with a Universal Income card that would make your parents green with envy.

And a clunky but fantastic and privacy respecting gadget,\
that will lead you through world's most bellowed modern non-fiction.

Don't, le...
