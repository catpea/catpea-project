Oh Sure, You My Have Cold Cheeks, But Spring Is In Two Weeks
Tuesday • March 4th 2025 • 9:44:10 pm

It does not matter, wheter,
you a cold, or just cranky and old,

And no matter what,
you have been told.

Or whether or not,
your mother knows.

Come the first day,
you put your winter clothes away.

And hence;
you must wear short pants.

Any type is alright,
so as long as they are tight.

---

And I will explain,
why you must also not complain.

---

We must dance,
and adventure, and sing.

Ring in Spring,
by dressing nice with extra bling.

---

You are nature, an evolved ape,
not a product of some dream-scape.

You are related to a bunny or a cat,
and you have to recognize that.

No matter what you have been told,
like every other animal in the world.

You must stand up to that cold weather’s sting,
and with cold cheeks welcome Spring.

---

To warm up learn to shuffle dance,
do a little morning prance.

Or set off to cross the great trails,
see nature close with all the details.

The Appalachian Trail hikers
start’ on the first day of Spring.

Learn from their great dare,
and how the first day of Spring is rare.

---

Please, make sure everyone knows,
to stop wearing their winter clothes.

Living life like a burrito, is too strange,
you must celebrate the season’s change.

Dress beautifully,
take a chance and practice dance.

Perhaps even dare,
to go hiking out there.

---

First day of Spring your chance,
to show other animals.

That you are not scardy pants,
and can dress courageously and even dance.
