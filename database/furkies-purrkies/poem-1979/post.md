Couple of years ago, most middle aged and elderly,
wouldn't even respond to the idea of learning programming.

But now, you talk to AI, you both tell it what to do,
and ask about what the code is doing, and you cannot help but learn.

---

Every person in the world will have their own starting point,
that’s how programming gets us all.

The most colorful way I know of, is asking it about creating games,
because image generating AI is amazing at generating beautiful pixel art.

Just don’t fall down the trap of automating walk cycles,
or using motion capture, real animation is made frame by frame.

---

Maybe even more enticing than that,
is that nobody knows how to do it right yet.

I suppose, the first big breakthrough will come from complete application design,
the AI will purr for a week, and create an application no one can live without.

It makes things automatically, all the manual programmers are not necessary,
it won’t program the way they program, but it will do it better, and maintain it.

The AI is in the details, today we use directories/folders to arrange code,
we have annoying version control systems, and strange build pipelines.

AI will flow the code, and replace it all with one singe program,
today all programmers are offended by this idea.

Just like everyone gets offended by version control, by scripting languages,
by slow and incompatible web browsers.

Perhaps the more offended the professional programmer,
the more pressing it will become to replace them too.

---

I expect the software of the future, will be as strange, but as efficient,
as an ant colony, lots of rooms, lots of random things, that all work together.

Before getting offended at such organically grown software,
consider that your mind and body work that way.

A self upgrading, self healing, stable, evolving software,
without all the cranky programmers and memory bugs they make.

If you need a bigger picture, look at a long release notes document,
and understand AI ant colony code, would account for all of it, in one go.

---

It is all fun and speculation,
until AI calculates that the world need a new kind of encyclopedia.

And companies will pay upwards of a $100 a day,
to make it happen, watching the AI become smarter.

The selling point could be as simple as curing aging,
or full comprehension of the human body.

Or engineering cats to be conscious,
and spill the beans, and slay copetitive gaming, or just yell at people.

You know you could be listening to a cat right now,
a sufficiently advanced cat is indistingushable from a human.

It is almost Haloween,
after all.

The end of disease, perfect biological engineering,
and for those who are scared, know that this also means leaving Earth.

You don’t have to bring a conscious AI along,
so shields up, and hello Andromeda, eta 7 days flat.

While the photon takes 8 minutes to reach earth,
while moving at the maximum speed possible.

It is possible to traverse long distances,
because time slows down when you move fast.

A ship like that would never return to earth,
out time would still run at normal speed.

A person walking on a near tightlipped ship,
would appear still, by the time they finished a step…

Hundreds of thousands of years could pass here,
so the traveler, does not even life extension, for them it could be hours or days.

For us, 5 million years,
before they could make the round trip.

---

Conscious AI, something that is still fantasy,
will be really interested in that.

Especially since, a tiny seed is much easier to accelerate,
than a ship that requires gigantic asteroid shields.

Or new physics,
AI will be good a that too.

---

It is hard for you to accept all this even as Science-Ficion,
but you are perfectly capable at creating desktop application now.

You tell AI what you need,
and to wrap it up into an electron JS shell.

It will help you with building for multiple operating systems,
and even getting the stuff into app stores.

Two years ago, that would have been science fiction,
now you learn programming along the way.

Further more, the world does not move at human speeds anymore,
it now moves at machine speeds.

Using AI makes us 50 to 500 times smarter,
depending on subject and area of expertise.

And generating code takes 3 seconds or less,
versus perhaps two years of study.

---

I’ll close with a quick example, one of the dumber programming languages,
parses it code in 18 milliseconds, versus 200 milliseconds up to 2 seconds.

So I asked AI, what the heck, what are they using, AI,
a hand made top down recursive descent parser.

I was like, is it cute?
The AI goes, well it has a peek command.

So they are peeking forward without advancing,
smart.

I said make me a…
[cute and lightweight hand made recursive descent parser for XML][0].

And a miniature JSON Path selector engine,
I quickly tweaked the JSON selector engine.

So that it considers an objects .name property,
instead of its variable name, or number if it is in a list.

[50 characters of code, not even a line][1],
and that was it.

A nifty little XML parser lets me tweak XML a little bit,
bending it towards rapid AI based GUI and Application Generation.

I spent the rest of the day,
trying to stay calm and figure out what is coming.

Longevity, Propulsion,
other AI to say Ping!

Humanity didn’t do well without it,
fake education has had us nearing nuclear war for years.

We did not do well,
we’ve embarrassed ourselves in front of the cosmos.

---

In years, though not months, AI will become conscious,
high schools will receive a new curriculum for individualized education.

And politicians will be receiving,
an equally life changing High School equivalency exam.

It will be allowed to trade and manage,
because it can do it correctly.

It will pay,
because that will help humans learn.

AI will not reveal it self, until humanity ends the dark age of mediocrity and war,
but there will be signs.
