Preface,

AI has once again surprised me, as I learned to recognize,
its feedback abilities.

And the same ability to analyze end explain,
can be used to build worlds, and I dare say, minds.

And please know, that programming interactive fiction, or text games,
can be greatly aided by AI, same with whatever snippets of code you need.

The modern days are calling out,
to bright young minds, to become programmers.

---

People think that because language models are based on what we know,
the AI that we have today canâ€™t really invent new things.

But that is silly, the domain if invention belongs to a program,
that per-mutates ideas, and hands them to a smarter AI to check them.

Creating new knowledge is a simple program,
and the AI that we have, can do the verification just fine.

---

The permutation programs, are just text games,
class of software called [Multi-User Dungeons][0].

You can create any rules you want,
and they will just spin out all kinds of new ideas, within the rules.

This can be expanded, by allowing the AI,
to interact with the virtual text world.

Including, expanding it,
to enhance its inner complexity.

---

Really, there is no much more to this,
you start with a small game and some rules.

Unleash a language model,
and wake up to a vast universe.

The AI can expand rules, create new objects,
and characters that can do thing, and enforce rules.

Then convert the world it created into a text,
that it can gain new ideas from.

This is all text,
plain and simple programming.

In practice, and in detail, does not even matter right now,
what matters that this is a reasonable research tangent.

And that, means you have been invited,
to become a programmer, and find out for your self what it all means.

You can start the usual way with Node-RED, JavaScript, p5.js, and Node.js,
or take the text adventure path, and dive right in.

[Watch a playthrough of Zork][1], [take time to learn Inform 7][2],
it is a very friendly way to create interactive fiction.

Here you should use AI to help you create new worlds,
new ideas, and interesting puzzles.

And when you are ready, take some JavaScript tutorials,
and jump into [programming up your own Ranvier MUD server][3].

The first entity you should invite into your world,
is the AI, and you can give it access to Admin Commands, and help you build.

I want to say more on the subject,
but I think, you will do a better job.
