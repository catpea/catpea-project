It is all about results,
and evidence.

---

As always boys got confused,
muscle failure is a myth.

Which is to say the central component,
of what they think is bodybuilding is a made up lie.

Probably by some adult, pretending to know something,
to collect unearned prestige with false advice.

---

The myth is so strong,
that what you are about to hear is considered influencer trash.

But, you yourself can almost in a thought experiment alone,
tell the difference.

If you jog with dumbbells, not too light,
but not so heavy that they will stop you.

You will see results on your legs and midsection in weeks,
results that you can’t get from lifting heavy for 15 seconds.

Let me repeat, the myth is so string doctors believe it,
and there is medical research to prove that I am wrong.

But you just need a moth of jogging with light dumbbells,
to see that duration and challenge is key to fast bodybuilding.

---

I call lifting heavy cutting off circulation, or choking,
but lots of things are going on when disrupting the body with heavy weight.

The results from lifting heavy are so minimal,
that whatever it is, it might as well be cutting off your circulation.

I just call it that,
to make what you are about to hear simple.

In terms of evidence, results are evidence,
lifting heavy, dos not produde pronounced results beyond the initial going to the gym.


Lifting heavy and proper form, whatever the heck that is,
is vastly inferior to gently staying on the edge of what you can do.

Starting with three pounds, and gently moving up towards 20,
as your body adapts, during your simplified dance.

---

I’ve seen it happen, an adult that grew up all to quickly,
who may secretly think that they didn’t actually grow up.

Brought in their boy, sat them in a chair,
and told them to lift maximum heavy.

Risking torn muscles, certainly pulled muscles,
potential back injury as they drag the heavy to the rack.

The lad never returned, because it was all pointless,
impossible and stupid.

---

We have to use harsh words, an injury at the gym,
can really screw someone for life.

And it is rooted in pretending to know,
so it is a pointless and stupid injury.

We ought to use bad words,
because a line needs to be drawn.

---

Boys are taught and then spread the myth,
that muscle failure means muscle growth.

And what they are actually doing,
is just cutting off their circulation.

During their exercise,
they couldn't do worse.

If you tried, to stop someone, from growing muscles,
would you not try to get them to cut off their circulation.

Choke their muscles,
force them to sit.

And which is almost as bad,
make them feel they are not lifting heavy enough.

And the heavier they go,
the shorter the duration of their lifting.

Their already dangerous, and useless exercise,
becomes even more dangerous, and useless.

---

We should be mad at this,
we need to use strong language.

---

This is where you begin your workout,
by understanding that they are all doing it wrong.

In fact if you did a little bit of jogging,
and saw your leg muscles develop over a few weeks.

You know the speed at which muscles grow at,
if you gave yourself 3 or 5 pound dumbbells.

Your legs,
would have kept on growing.

And you can easily imagine,
how dumbbells influence every muscle as you jog.

You are adding strain, a challenge,
to a very dynamic system, your body.

The harmony,
of muscles, joints, and bones, to say the least.

---

Now that you can see jogging with dumbbells,
you should be able to see, two more mistakes boys made.

They are not focusing on duration,
which is more important than the weight.

Joggers, in their body genius,
know that it is not jogging until you are not stopping.

They focus on gaining,
an hour’s worth of endurance.

Which you should do,
with three and then five pound dumbbells.

You won’t need much more advice than this,
when you see the results after few weeks, not years.

It only takes years, when you are cutting off your circulation,
and then are forced to sit for entire minutes.

And the second mistake boys do here,
is that they won’t start in the middle of the rack.

If you tried that, jogging would be impossible,
how fan can a person jog with 30 pounds of iron.

It would be like cutting off your circulation,
you would cut yourself off from finishing your jog.

You would destroy,
your exercise session for the day, and risk serious back injury.

---

Boys have no endurance,
and won’t start in the beginning.

They aren’t just cutting themselves off,
they are locking themselves out of body adaptation.

---

If you don’t like jogging, interval times can help you simulate it,
they help you eliminate rest periods.

Substituting jogging landmarks and a watch,
for a very similar somewhat synthetic experience at the gym.

You just measure how long you lift 5 pounds while gently dancing,
and how long you need to rest to do it again, for 30 minutes at first.

You enter the two into the interval timer,
and over time you you shorten your rest duration.

Jogging comes with scenery, but the gym has restrooms and safety,
and no rain, or slipping on ice, or twisting your ankle in the dark.

---

You can probably tough it out for an hour with 5 pounds,
but bodybuilding is not supposed to be tough.

It is a dance,
it does not hurt.

The adaptive component is about increasing dumbbell weight,
never by more than 2.5 pounds.

It would be best if you did it by one or one and half pound,
by using unobtrusive wrist weights, be good to yourself.

And then extending your workout duration,
and then increasing the frequency with which you work out.

---

Finally, once dancing at the gym, you switch exercise,
once your arms start feeling fatigued.

You can lift above your head, to your side,
curl your arms.

Once you have your hours worth of endurance,
cycling dumbbell exercises around during your dance, lets you keep moving.

Just to clarify some more,
I’ll close with this:

Lift light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy, that you are forced to stop.
