Soon after Lady Philosophy gives you a small nibble,
you greatest thoughts will hurry in at a proper dribble.

You will no longer find yourself at the library with a hiccup,
you will always know which books to pick up.

When dumb teachers chase you with a paddle,
philosophy books will protect you at a comfy waddle.

You’ll beat all great challenges in a wiggle,
come out of the worst situations with a giggle.

---

Philosophy is the manual of well lived life,
it is no surprise it pushes away all the strife.

---

After you are done with the first handful o'books life’s no riddle,
you can just prance around composing with your fiddle.

Buuut, to read a book well you must snuggle,
to release its secrets it needs a warm cuddle.

That kind of warmth can only be found in a sleeping bag,
out in a tent laid out deep in the forest shag.

Before you build your warmest nooks,
know not to just read, but to listen, to wise narrated books.

We are story tellers and listeners, it is our butter,
every one of the wise books must be taken in with a flutter.

Like in ancient creation stories growing up means adventure,
Nature and Wisdom still holds the most powerful venture.

---

But you got to get there fast, at a sizzle,
you don’t want all your wisdom above your head with a wizzle.

Life is a form of beautiful art,
and you need you wisdom right form the start.

Everyone who chooses to live, eventually steps in some puddle,
Philosophy teaches you to step right out without much muddle.

---

What is more, that beyond wisdom at a flutter,
and even far above our butter…

Is that human beings are by nature are Happy and Cute,
and wisdom teaches us __when__ to give a hoot.

You have to keep that sparkling shimmer,
and live with a bright glimmer.

With love of life and wisdom in heart,
your life cannot help but to become a work of art.

As much as life of wisdom is dear,
we must also ensure to keep of good cheer.

And and as you go, there is one more thing you need to know,
In wisdom, you stop aging and begin to grow.

You move from counting each wrinkle,
to seeing each as a cosmic sprinkle.

Philosophy helps us grow all the way up with a rumble,
and in turn we become cheerful and never grumble.
