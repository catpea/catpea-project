Does The Gym Hurt?
Tuesday • December 10th 2024 • 11:16:42 pm

No. But, but at first, when you body is coming out of a sedimentary lifestyle,
it will go through a two week awakening period.

You will feel odd pain and discomfort,
during that initial adaptation process.

And it may make exercise difficult,
so you must switch up your routine, and skip a day or two.

---

These are your muscles
the tissues that your body contracts and relaxes to create movement.

Tendons,
the connective tissue between your muscle and bone.

And ligaments,
bands of connective tissue that connect bones together.

Beginning their adaptation process,
because it is an new thing to your body, it will try to stop you with aches.

---

This is temporary, nobody who is serious about the gym,
remembers any of it – it is jus the two weeks that nobody pays attention to.

---

When one of the more famous bodybuilders was asked about using pain killers,
he quickly, and responsibly, replied: I never heard of such a thing.

The boy asking the question, wasted his opportunity for a neat question,
because was under the impression that the pain lasts more than a couple of weeks.

Again the bodybuilder,
completely ignored the question.

Because, that issue does not exist,
aches are so temporary, that everyone who visits the gym often forgets them

---

That is right, if you visit the gym every two weeks, or two months,
same pain will greet you every time, during and after your workout.

The specific name for the after workout pain is DOMS, D.O.M.S,
short for Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.

The answer to your next question: is every other day,
I call it zebra striping.

You can visit the gym every day for rapid progress,
but your injuries will eventually overlap, so you will need weekends off to heal.

Monday, Wednesday, Friday is not enough,
every other day, or everyday with weekends off.

---

The only pain there is after the initial two weeks,
and it may take more than a couple if you are a buttercup like me.

Is the pain of injury,
each injury type is easily preventable.

---

Destroying your back,
is prevented by not lifting heavy.

And the understanding that athlete that do dangerous back exercises,
grew a heck of a lot of support back there.

A newcomer doing power-lifting,
is in a danger zone, and back pain is torture.

Do not take any ri...

...oblem after a few years,
but you want avoid injury, as soon as possible.

---

Finally, sets and reps are a lie,
that is just a gym myth for young boys who want to look tough.

Real excessive has two phases,
training for your exercise, which takes months.

And the actual exercise,
which takes a lifetime.

---

The training does not only prepare your body,
but teaches you how endurance works.

And the training is jogging with lightest dumbbells for one hour,
and perhaps making your way up to 5 pounds per hand.

Aside from giving you endurance,
jogging will remind you to close your rest gaps.

You are training,
not to stop for very long, and certainly not because you need to rest.

Only once you are able to jog non-stop for an hour,
do you walk into a gym, slap on leg weights (you may need to hide that).

And begin pushing yourself,
to make your gym excessive harder than jogging.

You still likft light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and of course not so heavy, that you must stop to rest.

Let your body and endurance catch up,
to higher weights, if you go two fast your body will not be ready and will stop you.

When jogging you basically just carry your dumbbells,
make sure to protect your knuckles during a fall.

Since your hands are busy,
make sure that the dumbbell is high enough to protect you as you drive it into the ground.

There is a new pickle type of dumbbell,
they look like rods, but they maybe bad for running with dumbells.

---

At the gym you lift your dumbbells to the side, and above your head,
in ways that are too hard while jogging, so that I is the actrual exercise.

[Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1], [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2],
and [Overhead Shoulder Press][3].

When one muscle group gets tired, you don’t stop,
but switch to the next exercise or some variation.

Once you are able to flex your body,
you then begin to [shuffle dance][4], which is why the shoes are so important.

This will transform your body in less than two years,
but if you excessive any other way, it will take 20 or 30 years.

Lift Long,
And Prosper!
