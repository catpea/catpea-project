When things around you are broken,
it does not mean that you should break them some more.

Great warriors have fought for what little you do have,
and you have to protect it, cherish it, and keep building.

Look at you, you spent years in schools tricked into thinking,
that memorization was a form of education.

And now you are poor, desperate, alone,
and thing around you make so little sense that you want them desecrated.

---

Lies and mediocrity took much from you, knowledge, wisdom, dignity,
self control, joy and laughter, and love of life.

Not to mention what inheriting your culture from movies did to you,
you are now in the wrong places, and some of you traveled many decades.

You do not kneel, and give them more,
because they will take everything from you, all of it, including you.

---

For all the tricks in the sleeve of mad men,
they must continue lying, constantly, all the time.

But you just need the Ancient Trails,
this time with hundreds of narrated Adventure, Science and Philosophy Books.

Three season tent, bunch of duct tape too,
your backpack, your home and your burden, but also sausages.

---

It is sure to rain, there maybe snow, it will fell like hell,
but I can feel you smiling already.

Bee good to the mice, most of the hikers,
are much filthier, the mice are just desperate, the way you once were.

But, this isn’t about the trail,
or the other warriors there...


Though you will bow to each other,
and grant each other helpful trail magic without asking for anything in return.

---

It is about how the great beings from your narrated books,
will yield their culture unto you.

It was never philosophy,
that was always meant to be a simple word.

It was about the culture you inherit,
and the paths you resume as a result.

Though both are beautiful, wisdom and culture of greatness,
is the same as memorization is to comprehension.

The culture of greatness, of beings ennobled by their deeds,
who set an angle and kept rising until they became great beings.

It wasn’t the knowledge,
it was always about the culture of decency, dignity, in and greatness.

On these trails you will discover that what you once held dear,
as your highest of heights, was just your first step.

---

To love the world, you will have to learn to trust others,
and in other for them to be trustworthy they too must rise to greatness.

All of you must make that journey,
you must unclouded your minds on the trails.

So that you discover or rediscover,
your health, your clarity, your strength, and your wisdom.

Go now, you have shopping to do,
the lifeline you were on no longer runs true.

Go get your boots, and thick socks, pack,
and do not forget the snacks to make tasty trail mix with.

---

So many of you do not learn,
until it is the end of your days.

That you are each meant to grow all the way up,
and become a great being.

You beautiful mind demands a full authentic start to ignite,
go, go find it, now, do it for your older self.
