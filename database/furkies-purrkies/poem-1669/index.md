I just had ten, three hour workouts,
with a 10 pound vest, it was good, safe on the back.

But, you must absolutely purchase a vest,
that has 20 or 30 pounds of removable weights.

As that will ensure,
it is made out of sturdy materials.

You should start with wearing 10lb,
it will feel like nothing, for just about two days.

And then you will discover,
that muscles have registered it.

There will be a hint of tiredness,
a tiny bit of fat burn, all good benefits.

---

10 pounds is nothing to sneeze at,
your body will burn fat, and grow muscle.

---

And you need to be able to wash the fabric,
in a washing machine, perhaps set to delicate.

You will sweat during a workout,
and I used a little bit of moisturizer as well.

I used it under my arms,
and above shoulders, I did not get scratched up.

Initially, I had good luck wiping down neoprene,
but eventually I couldn't clean it well enough.

So avoid the neoprene kind of vest,
and as it is rubber, it may deform over time.

You want something that isn’t a sponge
that you can meaningfully wash.

Neoprene weighted vests feel nice,
until you realize you are not wiping them well enough.

And they maybe trapping moisture,
which brings us to an issue even bigger than cleaning.

---

You have to know what is inside,
because I just returned a vest that started oxidizing.

It was filled with raw iron pellets,
and after five days, they started rusting.

There was rust powder,
coming out of the vest.

The iron pellets are rusting,
and rubbing against one another, producing powder.

I was one day away from staining my workout clothes,
and iron may not be good for sensitive skin.

My other vest, which I will also return,
has rocks in it.

Which brings us to the second issue,
everything needs to be adjustable.

My other vest has wide elastic bands,
and even stretched they are too short.

Bodybuilders are not,
one-size-fits all.

And you also need to make adjustments,
based on the cut of your workout shirt.

You want to avoid the vest,
scratching your skin

Neoprene would be great it it didn’t trap water,
and deform over time.

All we can really have in this area,
is cotton backed woven nylon.

That maybe similar,
to what military will uses.

It needs to be hella strong,
and not scratchy on the inside.

It needs to be two materials,
one that does not deform, and other that does not scratch.

---

In summary, removable weights so that you can adjust them,
and machine clean the vest it self, on a delicate setting.

No neoprene, as it will deform, it is still scratchy,
it traps moisture, and when the moisture does get out, it will stain.

You have to know what is inside,
it can’t be iron as it will rust/oxidize and really smell.

All the straps need to be adjustable,
perhaps with the exception of the hole for your noddle noggin.

In some vest styles,
but you want straps everywhere.

And in a way,
that won’t scratch you.

The best material, is a combination of hardcore woven nylon
that can carry 30 pounds for three years without deformation.

And something forgivable on the inside,
some thick soft fabric.

Finally, a weighted vest,
is a free workout, within your workout.

It is strange, that people show up at the gym,
without a vest, and leg weights, even.

They burn fat for energy,
and build muscle to adapt to new weight.

That is a pretty good deal, and please remember,
you gently add weight over time.

You are not supposed to put all 30lb in at first,
maybe start with 5 pounds, and go slow.

Yah, a weighted vest,
is a pretty cool idea.
