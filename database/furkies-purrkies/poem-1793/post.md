Philosophy is for life,
but becoming a philosopher is just a stepping stone.

It is really an extension of when you were little,
and proved to everyone that they knew nothing, by always asking why?

As a young philosopher,
you accept the responsibility for finding your own answers.

You will be glad to know,
that there is no such thing as academic philosophy.

It is just more make believe education,
where you are sold an impression of education.

Real philosophy starts in you,
and stays in you.

It is of no use to speak in abstract or generic terms here,
this is far too important, so let me tell you how it worked for me.

One of my greatest questions when I was title,
is whether or not I should fight a bully.

The answer is no,
because the bully’s attack isn’t physical.

The bully is a machine spun out of control,
looking to make a copy if it self.

The way it triumphs,
is in making you, a snarling beast too.

A bully is like a zombie,
a host to a virus that wants to spread.

When I came to America and heard Dana Sculley,
say “Mulder, there has got to be a rational explanation for this.”

I immediately begun looking into UFOs and Aliens,
it was an amazing journey, in learning about early religions.

Aside from it taking me to the New York Public Library,
where I read about a Bigfoot being beamed down from a UFO.

As storied mixed, with aliens, bigfoot an angels, and dinosaurs,
it just turned out to be a fantasy.

Later, one of the Science Popularizes asked an Alien witnesses,
“What do you do for living?”

And the son of a gun straight up answered,
“I am a science fiction writer.” - fantastic.

Ultimatley curiosity about UFO’s led me to ,
actual thinking where I got to real and listen to.

So you see what I was doing,
I was simply questioning.

That is what philosophy is about,
and how Philosophy, gave birth to her daughters, the Sciences.

The natural philosophers,
simply questioned, searched to reproduce, and for, evidence.

I also didn’t get stun by school much,
I’ve learned programming on my own when I was in my early teens.

And I could see, that teachers were not doing any thing like it,
they were not teaching, anything functional or effective.

They were certainly not leading the class towards learning and discovery,
it was just a scam for paychecks.

But here is a fantastic example of questioning status quo,
do you think cramming is helping you, or is it really helping your teacher.

Did you invent it,
or did the teacher cleverly forced you into it.

Becoming a young philosopher is about power,
that you gain from holding evidence in your hands.

From holding real answers,
and being able to spot the lies.

And ultimately point,
at the men who sold the world.

Becoming a philosopher is just just a stepping stone,
because it is your duty both to humanity and your older self.

To grow all the way up,
and become a great being.
