The Story of Kitten In A Cup, Inc.

The origins of Kitten In A Cup, Inc. trace back to a simple yet profound childhood dream — a dream that would evolve into a groundbreaking vision that redefines how we connect with the world of pets.
As a young boy growing up in Michigan, Periwinkle Purrkies, the founder and CEO of Kitten In A Cup, Inc., often found himself mesmerized by the natural world around him, particularly the vibrant and energetic black squirrels that danced through the trees near his home. To him, they were more than just wildlife — they represented a spirit of playfulness, independence, and curiosity. His dream was simple: to own a squirrel, to experience firsthand the joy and companionship that such a creature could offer.

However, as Periwinkle grew older, he realized that his dream was more complex than he initially understood. The traditional notion of pet ownership, confined mostly to cats and dogs, felt limiting. The world, he felt, needed a new kind of companion, one that could offer not only companionship but also a sense of whimsy and surprise. This epiphany sparked the birth of Kitten In A Cup, Inc.
Years of research, innovation, and dedication followed as Periwinkle worked to make his vision a reality. The challenge was not just about acquiring a squirrel, but about transforming the concept of what it means to have a companion animal. Drawing inspiration from the playful, cheeky nature of squirrels, Periwinkle created an experience that combined the charm of a pet with the excitement of an ever-evolving journey.

At Kitten In A Cup, Inc., we proudly introduce the black Michigan squirrel — with its signature lightly shaved tail — as the embodiment of this unique vision. But the journey didn’t end there. Periwinkle wanted to ensure that every customer could experience the same joy he had as a child, with a delightful twist. To make this vision come to life, each squirrel is not only trained to use a specially-designed shaver to maintain its distinctive appearance, but each customer also receives a complimentary shaver to engage in the fun and care of their new companion.

This innovation reflects Periwinkle’s commitment to making the squirrel experience truly special and personal. It's about more than just owning a pet; it’s about sharing a connection, a tradition, and a sense of wonder that can only come from the extraordinary. Periwinkle’s childhood dream of owning a squirrel has transformed into a business that invites others to be part of that same story — a story where nature, joy, and creativity converge.

Kitten In A Cup, Inc. is not just a company; it’s a movement. We are proud to offer a product that blends a unique animal companion with a playful, experience, grounded in the values of care, respect, and innovation.

As we embark on this journey, we invite our customers, partners, and investors to share in our vision of bringing the wonder of nature and the joy of owning a squirrel to the world. Kitten In A Cup, Inc. represents more than just a business venture — it is a manifestation of a childhood dream brought to life with passion, purpose, and professionalism.
