Don't worry that it is your first time,
here are some words of wisdom for you.

Everyone is doing it the slow way,
because they think exercise is magical.

As a result,
they only grow muscles once.

When they go from not working out,
to working out wrong.

---

The biggest mistake,
everyone is making…

Is to emphasize the amount they are lifting,
over the the duration that they are lifting for.

They corner themselves,
by lifting too heavy for no long enough.

And not being able to lift for longer,
because their weight is too heavy.

---

Duration first means,
you learn to walk for one hour.

Then jog so slowly,
it might as well be power walking.

And when you can move hard,
for one hour, non stop.

You grab onto the lightest of dumbbells,
one in each hand.

And you do your jogging or power-walking,
with dumbbells in hand.

The faster you move,
the more fat you burn.

The heavier your dumbbells,
the more your muscles will grow.

---

You must start in the beginning,
because your body needs room to adapt.

It needs a signal persistent enough,
to figure out adaptation is needed.

And a runway long enough,
to adapt, so that you can do more.

---

You can see how lifting too heavy,
forces you to stop too soon.

If you start,
in the middle of the weight rack.

You will never,
get to lifting for one hour.

But if you start by lifting light,
for one hour.

You can see,
how sending such a message.

Will not only have your body adapt,
but make it feel effortless.

At which point,
you will be able to lift heavier.

---

It is very important you understand,
that you start in the beginning.

And lift light,
but not so light that you can lift more.

And never so heavy,
that you will be forced to stop.

---

You can see how useful 3lb. dumbbells are,
they may not give you muscle.

But they will prepare you,
for 5lb dumbbells, which do grow muscle.

And then 7.5lb dumbells,
which give you an athletic body.

And are somewhat easy to dance with,
or quickly twist and turn with.

If not, wait until 7.5 feels,
comfortable.

And head on up,
to 10lb dumbbells.

10lb. Per hand for one hour,
is a lot, it is the bodybuilder territory.

Synchronize your motion with beats of songs,
to enter a dance trance and make time fly.

And use hiker food,
to fuel your body.

Peanuts,
dried fruit.

---

There is a bit of strangeness,
that you need to be aware of.

Gyms are hot,
mornings in a park, are not.

Gyms will not let you walk or jog,
with dumbbells...

On the treadmill,
as that really is dangerous.

And you can imagine,
how the machines at the gym, ruin a workout.

Dancing with dumbbells,
or cycling standing dumbbell exercises to music.

So that different muscle groups can rest,
and you don’t have to stop.

Helps your back, legs,
abdominal area.

If you sit, or isolate muscles,
you go from a full body workout.

To two or four musclces at a time workout,
which has got to be the slowest way to get fit.

Imagine if you were tasked,
with creating something that slows people down.

Would you not invent a machine,
that makes you sit, and just work on two muscles.

---

More than that,
the spacing between the weights is too much.

2.5lb as the ladies dumbbell rack has,
is perfect, 5 or 10 pounds probably prevents adaption.

Your muscles, like it when you move slowly,
not leap into a crushing weight.

---

Aside from that,
the aches and pains are temporary.

If they ever return, that means,
you waited to long between your workouts.

---

To burn fat, visit as often as you can,
and lift to the fastest songs you can handle.

To build muscle, stay around 100bpm range
meaning 50 lifts per minute.

One beat to lift up,
next beat to lower down.

Aim not to stop, to eliminate all rest,
maybe double your duration to two hours.

And keep walking and twisting and turning,
to support circulation and full body exercise.

---

Your exerciser will look odd,
but you will show changes weekly.

And they will get bigger as you go,
which will motivate you to keep going.

To keep going,
to continue challenging yourself.

A little bit,
at a time.
