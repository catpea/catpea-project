There is nothing more important,
then your intellectual inheritance.

The most powerful and life changing ideas,
observations, hopes and dreams.

Great books are a product,
that is impossible to re-invent on your own.

They aren’t just works of multiple people,
but multiple generations and eras.

Tyrants expect you not to listen to books,
they count on you living in a dark age.

All tyrants are mad,
sick, twisted, blind, and crazed.

And that very madness,
is the root of war, and wage slavery.

If the world had no mad leaders,
we would be no war, no poverty.

---

But without books,
entire nations fail to spot madness.

They may even eagerly vote,
on people that will harm them.

And never understand,
what went wrong.

Mad men, count,
on uneducated voters.

---

Poverty, stress, religion, division,
are all ways to turn off curiosity.

To blind people,
with fear and worry.

And there is no understanding books,
in that kind of darkness.

---

Without books,
you are robbed of vision.

You are robbed of light,
to never hear or read them.

Instant defeat,
lost before thing.

---

The greatest trick the tyrants played,
was to pretend books are optional.

---

If there is one tradition,
that a family must have.

Or a tradition that can be called,
the single most important one.

It is the escape from the ordinary life,
to the trail, long, beautiful, nature trail.

For the sole purpose,
or rekindling…

Our natural hunger,
for banefyre stories.

A narrated book,
is often a 10 or 20 hour story.

---

A book written by a great being,
will help you inherit parts of their culture.

Will help you step into the family,
of great beings.

In a word you befriend the author,
and the best parts of that friendship stay with you forever.

---

There is no such things,
as being changed by one book.

You will never find a perfect one,
not for long, anyway.

But non the less you take many strips,
from many books…

And splice your very own,
culture of greatness.

In a word you are rising,
in your won sequence, at your own pace.

And thus extending yourself,
out of dark ages…

Into a future,
of your won making.

It is your own culture,
braced with great wisdom.

---

I recommend walking the Triple Crown,
Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails.

But any trail that awakens a need for books,
will do.

If you camp long enough at a state park,
or wilderness, that may work too.

---

This is not just about the journey,
you make with your feet, but also your mind.

It is a promise to your baby self,
who wanted to be an adult so bad.

Merely aging,
has little to do with growing up.

Growing up demands,
the inheritance of wisdom; and a culture of greatness.

To “grow up” does not mean,
to look like an adult.

Nor is there a limit,
to how far you should grow.

You must grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.
