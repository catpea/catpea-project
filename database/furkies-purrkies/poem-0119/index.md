For those of you who had trouble,

finding the Northern end of the I-275 Bicycle Tail.

Hines connects North and South parts,

but it is really hard to find the [North Entry Point](https://goo.gl/maps/AimpKxWarbhiX8zbA)

I got on my bicycle today,

and took some pictures.

You have to find the M-14 Overpass,

or an Overpass with a huge dark rail beneath.

That rail is the support beam,

for the Trail On-ramp.

A bit further down the road,

there is a road that leads up to the On-ramp.

![Ramp Access](files/poetry-0119-ramp-access.jpg)

It is a ramp specially made,

for the Handsome Adventurous Bicyclist.

It opens like the door to a secret garden,

very few people bicycle there.

![Continues](files/poetry-0119-continues.jpg)

The trail continues for many more miles,

all the way up to 14 Mile Road.

![Forever](files/poetry-0119-forever.jpg)

Over at 14 Mile it ends wonderfully unceremoniously,

it just pops out onto a sidewalk.

Where motorists jump in their cars slightly,

as you pop out somewhat dehydrated, a little crazed, and a bit wild.
