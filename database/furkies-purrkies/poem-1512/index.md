Teenagers pretty much know that school is fake,
they are in it for the diploma, so that they can move on.

Ut what they don’t quite understand yet,
is that they are being cheated out of of education.

School is for them, it is one of our greatest ideas,
but it is infested by liars and pretenders, basically.

---

If they but reject memorization, and charades,
they will collapse the entire scam.

They will fail tests designed for memorization,
both on local and state level.

Schools will be exposed,
and their accreditation will be in danger.

---

I believe the tipping point,
is learning something for real.

By learning programming,
an important language for the future.

And a subject that is self validating,
as in the programs won’t work unless they are done right.

They will gain the ability to spot fake education,
why am I not learning, like I learned programming.

Schools have grown to depend,
on all subjects being equally usless.

It makes the fraud of ineffective education,
easier to hide.

---

Many things that aren’t engineered on purpose,
are used for convenient cover and manipulation.

Military does not recruit young people because they are strong,
but because it is easy to lie to them at the mall.

---

But once the teenagers become convinced of the fraud,
they will put an instant end to it.

But the “No Memorization Protests”,
lead to more than AI based individual instruction.

They lead the younger generations,
out of the dark ages.

Out of cultures that fell behind,
or were engineered to drag behind.

Out of poverty and addiction, via AI backed,
Universal Income Programs.

And into the world,
that we have always promised them.

A world that is honest,
one that is more intellectual, and more protective.

A world where individual rights are honored,
but where everyone is urged to grow all the way up.

All the way, until every human,
rises to be become a great being.

---

In a well educated world,
there is neither room for ineffective education, nor fake politics.

With most of the useless disagreements gone,
humanity will turn to a convergence on good ideas.

Rather than divergence,
towards a divided and uneducated humanity ruled by bullies.

---

Parent’s redeem yourselves for tolerating school as a mere babysitter,
that helps with learning social skills.

The social skills that kids learn in a fake school,
often include alcohol and drugs, and certainly stupid ideas.

Teenagers need a culture that helps the grow up,
without regrets.

That culture can be had,
if you ask them to stop memorizing and ignore the resulting grades.

Help your children build LAN parties for gaming and programming,
help them to learn to install AI they can run at home.

And finally help them understand that the only way out of poverty,
is through meaningful, functional, authentic education; not memorization.

Help them with tutors, until they can make money from tutoring others,
and eventually get funding to build their little startups.

All the other seemingly prestigious professions,
may earn a lot of money, but they also start with a lot of debt.

Programming not only shows what real education is like,
but also requires no upfront investment, just video tutorials.

There is no greater betrayal, no greater curse,
than fake or ineffective education, that counts towards nothing.

There can be no progress without real education,
it is either all of us on none, and in that worst of ways.

Help them learn for real,
so that they may rise to become great beings.
