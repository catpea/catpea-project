Greatness, Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding,
a leader must have a complete understanding of out world.

For example being tough on crime, is in deed sound,
but also indicates a misunderstanding of the human condition.

Before being tough we have to prevent people,
from being fractured by poverty of mind and wallet.

This means education must be made more effective,
by using computers to ensure a personal experience.

And that debit cards, are prevented from falling below $100,
if the balance is less than $100 it will reset to $100 at midnight.

This is the price of doing business with money,
of bailing out banks and having an aptly named Wall St.

The $100 is indexed to inflation,
it will always allow for more than enough money.

And the total maximum that a person could pull out,
is just $3.5 million dollars, $36,000 dollars a year times 100 years.

---

The system of debit cards is already in place,
it is an easy software change to institute.

---

This isn’t just about having money,
above all this is about human dignity.

But also,
designed to keep politicians honest.

Many false leaders will sooner or later figure out,
that putting us into poverty on purpose.

And keeping education ineffective,
is an amazing way to keep the economy going.

Some call this Wage Slavery,
I call it Poor On Purpose

This terrible idea is defeated before it occurs,
you can’t control people with poverty, is they are not poor.

---

For those of you who are worried,
about everyone buying drugs.

Please understand that keeping a nation poor,
just to keep drugs away from their users is a very stupid an embarrassing idea.

---

Making education effective goes a long way,
to prevent people from fracturing as well.

For one, effective education, is class,
it makes a person classy, more dignified and restrained.

And combined with end of poverty,
it prevents a lot of people from seeking to self medicate.

---

Now, take a step back,
and look how tough on crime this idea is.

Who is going to rob a gas station,
where if they wait until after midnight they get another $100 bucks.

And how could an educated individual,
be pushed to commit the crimes that fill the prisons.

---

This is just one of 50 campaign promises,
that an authentic leader would make come true.

But elimination of poverty of mind,
is probably one of the most powerful and profound changes.

The countless many narrated books,
and great student exchange programs that schools turn into.

Teach the children that knowledge is not power,
but a way towards wisdom, and the call to resulting greatness.

You too my reader, are tasked with growing all the way up,
until you become a great being, who leave a profound legacy on human kind.

I ask you to seek out all the Adventure and Science Popularizer Audio Books,
and set off to through-hike the Appalachian trail, in search of enlightenment.
