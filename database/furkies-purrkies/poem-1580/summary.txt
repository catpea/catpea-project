Life Long For A Long Life; Or, Don't Make Fitness Unnecessarily Hard
Friday • June 28th 2024 • 11:29:07 pm

Your gym teacher lied to you,
and the bros don't know anything.

Gym class, is for teachers,
that can't even fake ineffective education.

---

But listen,
there is a severe danger, lurking here.

And that is giving up on fitness,
maybe after high school, on in your 20s or 50s, or 70s.

You can't do that, you are not allowed,
you can't do that to people that care bout you.

---

Your body demands a certain level of activity,
and rich nutrition, so that you always have everything it needs.

This has to happen daily,
so it can't be hell.

Do you hear me?
don't make it hard.

---

At certain times in your life,
you can spike your routine.

To become a jogger maybe,
or a bodybuilder.

But on average, you cultivate
a wise and unstoppable routine.

---

We were not designed,
to be office workers.

We very barely emerged out of chaos,
with good enough bodies to last a 100 years.

It is a magnificent winning lottery ticket,
it is just long enough, to begin forgetting stuff.

It is a fair stretch of time,
that will only expand.

As AI and Medicine advances,
and you learn to proper care for yourself.

---

Your nutrition and activity,
must match what you were evolved for.

Let me repeat this,
because that is your starting point.

Your nutrition and activity,
must match what you were evolved for.

Hunting, chasing, running,
twisting, leaping, lifting, sprinting.

And your nutrition, is just dried fruits,
that get absorbed into seeds and nuts in your intestine.

And bounce through, slowly, steadily, wisely,
giving up sugars at a stable rate.

This is very important for your exercise,
you need trail mix, or you run out of energy.

And you need the occasional parts of an animal,
that will feed your muscle.

Vegetable based protein,
seems to be just as good, and not as icky.

---

Jogging or better yet dancing with dumbbells,
comes pretty close to what you need.

Don't worry about,
Anaerobic vs. Aerobic.

Bros that cut off their blood flow,
during excerpt are simply uneducated.

They are dumb, having completely misunderstood,
science, medicine, text book models.

And whatever muscles they did put on,
they did it long ago, before their plateau.

They don't know who to grow muscle,
they lift too heavy, and do not advance.

---

You have to gradually build up your own routine,
base on evidence and models you can verify with your eyes.

You have to ask,
do joggers build muscled on their legs?

And what would happen,
if they put on a 10 lb. weight west.

And begun gradually, and wisely,
increasing their weight by 2lb.

Would their muscles grow, shrink,
or stay the same size, as their vest increases up to 40 lb.

---

You have to use your imagination,
you already have all the answers.

Could a hopeful jogger,
make any progress...

If they wore a 40lb. vest on their first day.
and hoped to slowly run a full marathon?

---

Could it possibly be better,
if they started with 3 or 5 lb. dumbbells.

And hoped to walk 10,000 steps,
and then power-walk, and then shuffle dance.

And then jog,
as they grew in capability.

---

And as you ponder these simple question,
always be mindful.

That you have a responsibility,
to people that care about you.

And you must never,
jeopardize your workout routine.

Just ask your older self,
what their regrets are.

---

Focus on building up your endurance,
to accomplish truly extraordinary things.

On creating something,
that is worth cultivating and protecting,

Your routine must be life long,
and you must live a long life.
