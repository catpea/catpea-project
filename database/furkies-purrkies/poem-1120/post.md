What we believe when we are young,
will influence our entire existence.

False beliefs can only resolve to regrets,
only wisdom can constantly steer a mind towards some measure of greatness.

The list of false beliefs, and things that end up as regrets,
is not that long, it is not that difficult to compile.

At the same time, we must also retire,
the factories, of false beliefs.

Largest of which are schools that force students,
to pretend that memorization and passing tests is a form of education.

---

We are simply not allowed to steer the younger generations, away,
from the futures that are most worthy of them.

Purposefully setting them up for failure,
is not allowed.

War is another one of the false beliefs that must be retired,
it fixes little and as history teaches merely delays more destruction.

The politics that lead to war must cease,
war must be prevented, nations must be helped not to fail, into war.

The most toxic of the facilitators,
of failure and false beliefs…

Are poverty and fake or ineffective education...
along with all flavors of indoctrination that imprison minds.

Poverty causes stress, hopelessness, it is a wall,
and real education demands serenity, so that our curiositie3s may bloom and call.

The false belief that standardized education is something other,
than a mere exercise in memorization-and-pretending-to-learn, holds the world hostage.

The result of fake education is simply people not knowing what is true,
they will in fact be lost in a maze.

False beliefs, warp a person’s view,
and they may use whatever real wisdom they have, to fight goodness and real facts.

They may disagree with World Peace,
or practice Science or Climate Change denial.

Acts of confusion,
that turn them against themselves.

We can’t fix schools by making children learn harder, and improving overall test scores,
that is impossible, and probably harmful.

The standardized curriculum is a fantasy,
that only works for a tiny fraction of students and forces everyone else to pretend.

Real education, a major part of which,
is gaining the ability to tell falsehoods and dead ends, from truths and worthy futures...

Is self directed, personal curiosity based, grade free, stress free,
lifelong, and ultimately aimed at helping the students to financial independence.

In a real school, authentic graduation is marked
by student success in real life.

Should their undertakings fail,
they are welcome back to school to sharpen their wits even more.

Teachers know, we all know,
that students are associating their intelligence with their GPA.

We kn9ow that ineffective schools are dishing out [doctored grades][1],
so that teachers keep their jobs, and [schools stay under radar][2].

It is not a matter of grade inflation,
but the fact that grades are incompatible with student assessment.

The only assessment there is, is success in life,
if the student failed to secure a safe future.

Their education was ineffective,
and school may not be paid, but rather it must try harder.

The greater fantasy here is that grades are real,
only real success in life, can measure effectivenss of education.

William Butter Yates beautifully and correctly stated that,
“It takes more courage to examine the dark corners of your own soul than it does for a soldier to fight on a battlefield.”

A large part of the mechanism that propagates false beliefs,
is teachers going along with everyone else, as not to cause trouble for themselves.

The truth is grades are not up for debate, they are a terrible idea,
that corrupts education and must be eliminated, in favor of real world assessment.

Real education is not a matter of luck, at all,
a student either has it or not.

If they do, they do well in life,
if they don’t they won’t.

---

Today, the only kind of authentic education is still found in books, especially narrated works,
celebrated, by all the world’s secular clear thinking intellectuals who select fact over opinion.

The inheritance of wisdom and knowledge found in works of great beings,
doubles to helps the reader to enter __the real__ human culture, the culture of Great Beings.

In greatness students will always successfully forge their own path ahead,
they will deal with all the misery and tragedy in life, with dignity and strength.

Lastly, it is not borders, cultures or languages that divide the world,
it is just the menace of poverty and fake education.

The unstoppable torrent of mind numbing consequences rooted in fake education and poverty,
holds humanity hostage, it makes us stand still, facing the same old mistakes.

---

Explain to your children, that to grow up, means to grow all they way up,
until they all become great beings, and converge in culture of greatness on World Peace.
