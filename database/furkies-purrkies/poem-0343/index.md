We should all learn how to sing,

I know it is very difficult to get going, but maybe I can help.

You will need a computer, a microphone, headphones,

and a free and open source program called Audacity

Find a song you like, something that you might have wished to sing before,

and try to sing the lyrics, while you are listening to it.

We all have a talent for singling along,

so focus on the sounds in your headphones and follow the lyrics.

Your first recording, may be a little underwhelming,

but, you need to record the song four times.

In Audacity, just keep adding New Tracks as you go,

and make sure they all align.

If yo have imported the song into audacity,

make sure to turn on Overdub (under Transport / Transport Options ).

Here is my first attempt at a song from my childhood, [Czterej Pancerni I Pies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Tank-Men_and_a_Dog),

I didn't listen to it live, I would just play the song, and a second later, repeat the lyrics.

\* NON-SYNC VERSION \*

And [here](files/czterej-pancerni.mp3 "Czterej Pancerni I Pies A Cappella") is the version I listened to live,

basically singing in sync with the original performer.

Not only is my self-quartet more in-sync,

but my singing is properly spaced to match the song.

\* SYNCED VERSION \*

Don't worry is there is a little bit of silence here and there,

it is just part of the performance.

While three or four tracks are enough for creating a neat a cappella effect,

keep singing, keep re-recording the lyrics, and paying more attention to how you sing.

The biggest deal about learning to sing,

is starting with something that is already beautiful, mixing your first four recordings will make them perfect.

Here is a song in English language to demonstrate the four voice a cappella effect slightly better,

I sing [Mad World](files/meow-world.mp3 "Mad World A Cappella") originally written and performed by Tears For Fears, it is one of my favorite songs.

(I have to warn you as it is a little bit sad,

still the lyrics are very beautiful, and I had an amazing time singing it.)
