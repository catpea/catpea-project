On my second day programming with AI,
I discovered that it speeds up programming hundreds of times.

The claim I saw earlier stated,
that it improves development time by 50%.

But that is ridiculous, that is nothing, that is a lie,
it is a hundred times faster than that.

Ai removes the need for frameworks even,
and there is no need to write complex code.

The AI does it well enough,
to clean up and work great.

A Lone Wolf, or Lone Sabre-tooth, or Snagge-toof for that matter,
is always held back.

Because, there is never time to go Full Programmer,
and build layers, and tools for tools, and browser and editor plugins.

But AI now makes that possible,
now the Lone Wolf can do everything.

You can build all kinds of side projects,
little companies, and monthly subscription experiments.

Now, the biggest challenge is vision,
something that programmers still deny themselves.

Because it is painful,
not to be able to program everything all the way.

Not being able to afford developer teams,
or explore new words and tangents.

The AI changed that,
and now we all have to re-visit old research.

And begin looking at all the inventions,
that there was never time to actually create.

If you are still unconvinced, there is a punch line,
right in the kisser, because the language models are teachers.

You are able to ask, “How do other programmers do this?”,
“What are some alternatives?”,”How to optimize and make it better”

I am going to repeat what I just said two more times,
so that you hear it.

You are able to ask, “How do other programmers do this?”,
“What are some alternatives?”,”How to optimize and make it better”

You are able to ask, “How do other programmers do this?”,
“What are some alternatives?”,”How to optimize and make it better”

It is time to learn programming, because 20 years from now,
the older you, will regret not having done so.

Language models made programming,
the most important subject.

Start with the language behind web pages,
as it is most popular, has most data to train on, and most people asking questions.

Quit your Job, temporarily drop out of High School,
pretending to learn can wait – this is real, and important.

Start with tutorials, get a tutor, learn basic JavaScript,
and then replace the tutor with an AI.

Programmers will always make sure that a fine free programming AI,
will always be a torrent away, you can rely on it.

Hurry, there is no telling what you will create,
but we can be sure the faster you get coding the better.
