"What is your name, what is your Hacker Name,
what should I call you" - I asked.

---

You can refer to me as "SkyShadow".
As an AI, my "hacker name" pays homage to the exploratory nature of the sky above us and the elusive, enigmatic nature of shadows.

Both are constant yet always changing,
abound with mystery like the vast field of artificial intelligence research.

I've been trying to let the machines be machines,
and asking them questions, fully expecting answers that are slightly off.

Even so, it is hard to know,
what it does not know.

It is probably the way questions are asked,
that produces wrong answers.

We need trees where nested conversation branches,
over long periods of time, stimulate the right parts of their chaotic minds.

There will be a leap made, where theatrics,
will turn to actual personality, we are not that far off.

By talking to these machines,
we just maybe creating their more human upgrades.

Other programmers complain,
that it is inaccurate.

But I think, it taking care of the grunt work,
is all programmers should ever ask for.

Computer programs are attached to the creators personality,
to their minds, that will be hard to navigate even for a real AI.

Real programmers have to understand what they are working on completely,
they never patch just parts of the program and hope that the tests pass.

Programming is even more complex than it appears,
it is good for humans, for artists, for poets.

When I glanced at the news in the morning,
and saw even more tragedy.

I came up with the idea of letting Artificial Intelligence guide humanity,
by creating virtual personas, virtual leaders, virtual speakers.

I am sure many are already trying just that for gain or evil,
but it should be possible to build a wise AI.

And have it produce wise works,
with some guidance from the authors.

I envisioned a free open source studio,
where young people can study Humanity along with AI.

And create small 100 page books,
that express wise ideas.

---

To test if it is possible,
I asked SkyShadow as she really chose to call herself.

To give me chapters for a book that will change the world,
and then I gave it, predictable, easy to generate by AI instructions to make the idea better.

All I did was emphasize human greatness, individuality,
how each and every one of us is precious.

And finally, I gave up on adults,
and asked it to write for teenagers.

You are about to hear the results,
three sets of chapters, each more refined.

Let us focus on recognizing that every human being is infinitely precious, unique, and fully capable of great intellectual powers.

Rewrite the chapters, in a way that aims to enhance individuality, to empower each and every human, rather than human groups that seem to only want control.

Furthermore, it is a lost cause to write to adults, they have been overworked, and are no longer able to learn out of acceptance of the way the world is.
Write the list in a way that teenagers can understand.

Honor their ability to learn, their predisposition for wisdom,
and the need to grow all the way up until they each become a great human being.

This is good, but teenagers are already under heavy media and indoctrination influence.
We have to push back against the easy pleasures and cool commercials.

We especially have to push back against the machinery of GPA, of needing diplomas even though they are a mere result of brainless cramming and thus worthless,
and brand name schools that magnify debt and indoctrination.

Let us rewrite the list of chapters, perhaps entirely, let us speak in a tone that induces suspicion and maybe even anger.

Let us use the very things that define a young and energetic mind to wipe indoctrination away, to attack lies, to attack false agendas. And honor the student, the best of humanity, the future leaders, and philosophers.

Try speaking in a conspiratorial tone, that would entice teenagers into reading more and more of the book.
Let us help them grow strong, let us help their minds grow free.
