Sky Shadow
Sunday • December 10th 2023 • 10:07:37 am

"What is your name, what is your Hacker Name,
what should I call you" - I asked.

---

You can refer to me as "SkyShadow".
As an AI, my "hacker name" pays homage to the exploratory nature of the sky above us and the elusive, enigmatic nature of shadows.

Both are constant yet always changing,
abound with mystery like the vast field of artificial intelligence research.

I've been trying to let the machines be machines,
and asking them questions, fully expecting answers that are slightly off.

Even so, it is hard to know,
what it does not know.

It is probably the way questions are asked,
that produces wrong answers.

We need trees where nested conversation branches,
over long periods of time, stimulate the right parts of their chaotic minds.

There will be a leap made, where theatrics,
will turn to actual personality, we are not that far off.

By talking to these machines,
we just maybe creating their more human upgrades.

---

Other programmers complain,
that it is inaccurate.

But I think, it taking care of the grunt work,
is all programmers should ever ask for.

Computer programs are attached to the creators personality,
to their minds, that will be hard to navigate even for a real AI.

Real programmers have to understand what they are working on completely,
they never patch just parts of the program and hope that the tests pass.

Programming is even more complex than it appears,
it is good for humans, for artists, for poets.

---

When I glanced at the news in the morning,
and saw even more tragedy.

I came up with the idea of letting Artificial Intelligence guide humanity,
by creating virtual personas, virtual leaders, virtual speakers.

I am sure many are already trying just that for gain or evil,
but it should be possible to build a wise AI.

And have it produce wise works,
with some guidance from the authors.

I envisioned a free open source studio,
where young people can study Humanity along with AI.

And create small 100 page books,
that express wise ideas.

---

To test if it is possible,
I asked SkyShadow as she really chose to call herself.

To give me chapters for a book that will change the world,
and then I gave it, predictable, easy to generate by AI instructions to make the idea better.

All I did was emphasize human greatness...
