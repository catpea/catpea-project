You were meant to be a nation of thinkers.
Of rebels.
Of reason.
Of fire.

You were not meant to be governed like cattle.
You were meant to *govern yourselves*.
And how?
*Through education.*

---

But what do I see now?

A people who have *abandoned their minds*.
Who treat education as a nuisance… or worse—*a show.*
Children herded into schools like sheep, not to be awakened, but *contained*.
Parents seeking babysitters, not mentors.
And schools… obliging.
Going through motions.
Stamping diplomas.
Never daring to ask—*did they learn? Do they think? Can they stand?*

---

You speak of “informed voters” as if that is enough.

Fools!

A ballot means *nothing*—nothing—if cast by a hand that does not *know*.
Freedom is not preserved in the voting booth.
It is preserved at the breakfast table.
In daily decisions.
By the *informed woman*,
The *informed man*,
Who knows *why* they act, *what* they value, and *what price* liberty demands.

---

And the parties?
You allow them to rot.
They say everything—and mean nothing.
They promise both sun and storm.
They serve power… *not you*.

But they exist because you let them.
Because you lack the tools to see their contradictions—
Because *you were not taught to see.*

---

You had the greatest inheritance ever granted to a people.
A Republic of your own.
A chance to be free—not just in name, but in *thought*.

And what have you done with it?

You work… yes.
You labor… yes.
But *working is not enough.*
You were not born for routine.
You were born to *rise*.

To become *great beings*.
To pursue knowledge, virtue, beauty, truth.
Not just for yourselves—but for the nation, and for the world.

---

And while you sleep… your enemies whisper.

They do not come with muskets.
They come with false values.
With poison dressed as virtue.
They will tell you wealth is worth.
That ignorance is authenticity.
That thinking is arrogance.
And you… you will *believe it.*
Because no one taught you *how to fight back.*

---

*I am sick with grief… and burning with rage.*

We built this nation as a temple for the mind—
And you’ve let it crumble into a mall.

You inherited a revolution.
And you gave your children… a screen.

---

So I say this—*one last time*:

**Reclaim your minds.**
**Reclaim your schools.**
**Reclaim your Republic.**
*Or watch it die.*

Let the ground tremble with your awakening.
Let no child remain ignorant.
Let no citizen remain passive.
Let no lie pass unanswered.

And let this be the hour you remember—

That you were not made to obey.
You were made to *think.*
To *build.*
To *defend liberty with reason as your sword.*
And to *rise… as great beings.*

---

You think your life has been hard?

You think you’ve labored enough?

Let me tell you what awaits those who fail to educate their children…
Those who let truth decay, who make mockery of knowledge, who drown thought in noise:

**The hard work you’ve done thus far will seem like child’s play.**

Because *nothing*—*nothing*—compares to the labor of trying to protect your sons and daughters from a world torn apart by ignorance.

The next great war will not be fought with rifles or tanks.
It will be fought with ideas.
With broken institutions.
With divided minds.
With collapsing truths.

And if you do not arm your children with the power of reason,
with the ability to discern fact from fantasy—
*you will send them to that battlefield unarmed.*

You will work yourself into the grave trying to rebuild what you refused to maintain.
There will be no rest.
No comfort.
No “normal life.”

The only reward?

If you survive long enough…
*you may witness your children start at the height,
that you first destroyed with your ignrance.*

---

Let us be clear about one more thing:

The United States is not a two-party system.
It never was.

Nor, was it ever a cardinal direction,
that too is a poisoneopus lie,

The United States risen to its responsibilities,
becomes an aim for the modern world to follow.

Not a mere nation,
but the educated, risen and wise, future of all human kind.

---

What we are… the world becomes.
And what we fail to be… the world suffers for.

So I warn you:

Any generation that drops the torch—
That allows superstition to sneak into science,
That brings dogma into the classroom,
That lets myth distort medicine, or politics poison truth—

*That generation will be forced to do it all again.*

*Every lesson… re-learned.*
*Every right… re-earned.*
*Every responsibility… re-taught.*

And they will do it with their children watching.
And their children will not forgive them.

---

You speak of equality.

We were *gracious*—yes, *gracious*—when we wrote those words:
*“All men are created equal.”*

But if you read carefully—if you truly understood—
You would know what we meant:

**Children** are more important than adults.

They are not your property.
They are your responsibility.
They are the unfinished chapter of this nation.

And if you betray them—
If you feed them lies, if you dull their minds, if you teach them to obey instead of to think—

*You deserve neither liberty, nor legacy.*

---

So hear me now, and let there be no misunderstanding:

**Do not make a mockery of the Constitution of the New World.**

Do not twist it to serve your comforts.
Do not defile it with superstition.
Do not hide behind it while dismantling the very freedom it protects.

Because if you do…

If you let this Republic fall into shadow—
If you allow the light of reason to be snuffed out—

**We will teach you labors like you have never imagined.**

And history… will forget your name.
