And it doesn't take very much at all,

it does not care if you are big, or small.

All that matters is that forward you go,

and it doesn't even matter how little you know.

What matters is that you dare,

and that you, truly, care.

---

That you care about our world,

and not blindly do what you are told.

That you care about all the people and creatures,

and appreciate all their unique features.

And that you care about the future far and beyond,

and if something blocks the way you respond.

Because we can think and dream,

we are a kind of a Universal Extreme.

We are born to rise to no end,

we are born to out think and transcend.

Each and every one of us must help the world unite,

the future is a story that we all write.

---

Do not be scared to believe,

and do not allow mediocrity to deceive.

You are not a worker, not a machine,

each and every one of us is a force unforeseen.

Rise, and rise to no end in sight,

for the power of wisdom is infinite in its might.
