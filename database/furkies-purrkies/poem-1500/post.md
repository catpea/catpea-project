You only need dumbbells,
but you have to start with 3 pounds.

It will feel like nothing,
but you will be preparing your body.

The aim is to lift 3lb dumbbells,
non stop for an hour.

Above your head, to the side,
bicep curls, and whatever else you got.

You have to lift,
to the rhythm of music.

This will induce a trance,
that will carry you through the hour.

All the machines,
are only useful for when you are hurt.

The dumbbells won’t give you a large chest,
but you can’t lay down in a gym.

Lift your dumbbells wisely,
never stop to rest.

This is why starting  with 3 pounds,
is so important.

It helps to ease your body in,
it is an introduction to the 5 pound dance.

Five pounds for an hour,
gets heavy, start in the beginning.

Though it may not feel like much,
focus on a full hour workout.

Learn to move to the beat,
learn to dance a little.

---

If you just jump into lifting 10 or 15 pounds,
you won’t be able to do it for an hour.

You may lift for 30 seconds, or couple minutes,
but that is not enough.

Even the seemingly novice 10 pounds,
will shut you down way too soon.

The first and foremost concern,
is a non stop workout, with whatever you can lift.

---

This already present a challenge,
that will tire you out.

So you have to measure your rest periods,
and attack them, cut them shorter every week.

Precisely the way joggers do it,
in their beginning.

---

Do you understand what I am saying?
you can’t just lift 10 pounds – not for long enough.

The 10 pounds must be accesses, unlocked,
by building up your endurance from 3 pounds.

And initially, from only being able to work out for a few minutes,
even without weights, and then needing rest.

And needing to eliminated,
as quickly as joggers eliminate their need to stop and walk a little.

---

When you access 15 pounds this way,
you will have very large muscles indeed.

But it is a healthy and honest,
endurance based workout.

And it is is not even painful,
or particularly changeling.

Going up by 2 pounds,
from 3 to 15 doesn’t really hurt.

---

Sets and reps, work much slower than this,
because you must stop, and rest.

The weights are too heavy,
and the progression too overwhelming.

Not only are you not lifting for long enough,
but heavy weights will cause frequent injuries.

“Begin at the beginning,
and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”
