Humanity is a lot more beautiful
it seems.

But in all the chaos and complexity,
mistakes sneak in.

And Humanity is not just making mistakes,
it also takes to treating symptoms as stand-alone.

Symptoms sometimes assemble into feedback loops,
where entire industries grow.

---

The reason why there is no clear advice,
on how to repair world's mistakes.

Is that they are repaired inside out,
by countless great beings, each performing a different task.

---

There are no centralized ways to solve our problems,
just like you rise, all others must follow, and rise as well.

The sooner the culture of pursuits of greatness emerges,
the better.

As the longer we delay the more causes, and symptoms, and loops,
and the more they seem like part of reality, rather than terrible mistakes.

---

Your beloved books, among many other things,
will help you to knowledge where you can plot star-charts of Humanity.

All knowledge eventually coalesces into your own wisdom,
combining with all the wisdom you inherited from books and authors.

---

You will discover that helping humanity heal and rise is a simple task,
so as long as it is distributed among all the people.

We just have to switch from synchronizing with our local culture,
to synchronizing with all the world's greatest intellectuals.

As that is where humanity's actual development occurs,
that - not the fake school or battlefield, and certainly not politics - is where humanity is advancing.

It is the World's Philosophers not the echo chambers,
that pave the way forward.

---

Becoming a philosopher, a lover of wisdom,
is just another simple step...

In the never-ending quest, to grow all the way up,
and become a Great Being.
