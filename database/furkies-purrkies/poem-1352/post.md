Internet today is almost unusable without web-page rewriting to remove distractions and annoyances,
and this will only get worse.

---

On the user end, artificial Intelligence will only improve,
[and we can already install Open Source AI free, on our home computer][1].

Internet is also a massive source of misinformation,
propaganda, advertising, and irrelevant things.

Furthermore, large companies with questionable ethics,
may attack useful Open Source programs, crippling their features.

And last but not least, computers are useful,
having an easy way to program them, makes them even more useful.

The combination of drag and drop Visual Programming Languages,
and even the most lightweight AI, will change everything.

---

First of all, a Language Model Intelligence can maintain,
your visual programming language.

It can make sure that all data sources are functional,
and if something changed somewhere, automatically update that data scraper.

Visual programming languages are not only simple for us to operate,
but for Home AI to interact with as well.

The AI is already able to create new, useful,
and custom visual programming blocks.

AI managed visual programming languages,
especially now that we can install AI at home, are bee’s knees.

---

I think there will forever be a content war between foolish corporations,
and users.

In part because of Language Model AI and Visual Programming Languages,
the corporations will always lose.

---

As to visual programming languages, they are strange beasts,
it is possible to use them on tiny screes like smartphones.

And programs only take minutes to put together,
and programming is a lot more fun, and certainly rewarding than reading the news.

---

Lastly, I wanted to share a few free programming libraries,
that help programmers with building or learning about Visual Programming.

For the user interface the programs that come time mind are:
https://reactflow.dev/, https://flume.dev/, https://www.svelvet.io/, and https://retejs.org/

There are also libraries for processing the data that flows across the wires,
and the top ones are https://rxjs.dev/, and https://baconjs.github.io/.

One example of a platform that would greatly benefit from visual programming,
today are UerScript managers most notably https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampermonkey

There is also a headless browser that can be programmed to crawl websites,
https://github.com/microlinkhq/browserless by  microlinkhq.

The free and open source Ai that can tie all this together is called,
the [Llama 2 LLM][2] and is released free for research and commercial use by meta or facebook.

While all of this information will quickly become outdated,
and technologies will meander their own way.

A programming AI,
will forever remain a great idea – so as long as it is not programming it self.
