Grow Strong My Comrade by Will Durant
Saturday • March 21st 2020 • 4:14:25 pm

Grow strong, my comrade … that you may stand

Unshaken when I fall; that I may know

The shattered fragments of my song will come

At last to finer melody in you;

That I may tell my heart that you begin

Where passing I leave off, and fathom more.”
