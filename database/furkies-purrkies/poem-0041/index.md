Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Six.

Today has been an interesting mix,

We have to be strong,

and go far and long.

We can't sit around,

looking at the ground,

We are each a hero,

and none are zero.

Everybody counts,

care for each other amounts,

It amounts to Happiness and Cheer,

and all the Wonders we hold Dear.
