Real Talk With MC Meow: Music Theory
Tuesday • January 19th 2021 • 4:28:35 pm

Music Theory is not something you learn or study,

it is something you independently invent.

Music theory contains a very important lesson,

there is an infinity within.

You can spend a life inventing music,

but you have to stop yourself, to live one.

Similarly, you can spend a lifetime

trying to create photo-realistic paintings.

But it is best to let the brush be a brush,

and let the paining say that it is a painting.

The perfection of a painting

is found in the rays of the sun it contains.

The perfection of a song,

is found in the way it makes a dancer's body move.

To sit down with sound synthesizers

is more about meditation than composition.

There are libraries of pre-made sounds out there,

and it is not a terrible thing to use them.

Just like it is better to learn to make songs,

by trying to replicate existing ones.

It is better to learn about good sound synthesis,

by making use of pre made sounds or sample.

The samples that you fall in love with,

will call to you, and eventually you'll recreate them.

Once you create a really good song that connects with you,

you can then re-synthesize your own version of the sounds within.

Music is about having fun, it is about creating beautiful things,

it is not about slaving over bare bone sound synthesis.

It is important to keep in mind that sharing fun, is even more fun,

songs that help people dance, may just be the loveliest kind of songs.

Let us make a strange little dance song,

out of existing sound samples.

We'll use the sounds found in

[Sam Aaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lTZ8Tuyu5I)'s Sonic Pi project.

---

It is not a bad idea to start with the Rhythm of the song first,

the rhythm is like a foundation onto which we can add Harmony and Melody.

If we started with Melody first,

the melody would not tell us much about the rhythm of the song.

Starting with rhythm we can get our foot tapping,

and those taps will dictate how that melody will move.

---

Using ready made samples

we can instantly get a nice drum setup going.

And then sprinkle in a bit of hats, or cymbals,

now to be fair, we got to get our shoes on, and dance it out.

A dance song must always be tested,

against the type of dancing that it will be used for....

...u are not relying on an echo to blend beeps into something richer,

You are relying on hand picked bass sample, or even a real guitar,

and there ain't no nothing wrong with that.

So now that we have the beat, the hat/cymbals, and the bass,

we now need to add that melody that goes on top of the bass, that will melt into the bass.

---

Now, before we you add a melody, you need to take a breath of fresh air,

we can't pretend that music creation is a science, it is a exploratory and generative process.

So we have to listen, and understand to the soul of the song we have just created,

my use of the Morse code, is kind of already whispering something.

When you really listen to the melody our Morse code created,

it sounds Russian.

We have to listen to the song,

the song is dictating a certain path through a maze of infinite complexity.

In this situation,

I went [NASA's website](https://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/index.html) and borrowed the sound of [Спутник (ракета-носитель)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_\(rocket\))

And our little Sputnik gives us melody,

here is what it sounds like.

At this point we have a tird of a song,

it is not a bad idea to end the song, with a variation on the begining, without ading anything new.

So that gives us about a minute and a half,

and we only need about 60 more seconds, as our dancer has better songs to dance to.

Since our song wants to be russion, let us grab a [recording of an old russian number station from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Russian_Man_signoff_2013-04-23.ogg),

and sprinkle in a bit more more sputnik at the end.

---

I chose to decorate the center of the song with a piano,

as that will pleasantly surprise our dancer.

Overall the songe ended up being very tanky,

but it is dancable.

If I had to do something differently,

it would be spending more time replicationg and studying othr songs to make the song less Heavy Industries and more [Cutting Shapes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Cutting+Shapes+Dance).

In closing, Building songs should not rely on a pre-set recipe,

it is a creative process that should invole lots of randomness and pleanty of dancing.

Here is the full song we just created,
