The Most Beautiful Way To Become Fit, Healthy, And Ever More Beautiful
Friday • February 21st 2025 • 9:46:04 pm

The most beautiful way is adventure,
far out in nature on grand hiking trails.

While listening to books about life and wisdom,
written by clear thinking great beings.

Obesity is not a problem with the body,
it is a problem with lack of vision.

And there is no faster and more beautiful way,
to regain vision, than to see nature, up close.

To experience Yellowstone, Yosemite,
the Grand Canyon, and Shenandoah Valley.

And once your body gets used to walking,
take to the Triple Crown.

The Appalachian Trail, The Pacific Crest Trail,
and The Continental Divide.

---

With all the world’s greatest philosophers,
whitelisting wisdom in your ears.

The journey to reconnect with nature,
and inherit your intellectual inheritance.

Will swiftly become one of your greatest challenges,
and most beautiful experiences.

---

Do not worry, you may return with little more,
that a packet of peanuts in your pocket.

But by that time, you will be by far,
one of the most visionnary creatures of the stars in all of universe.

If career is what you seek, then this is your call,
to become a guide those those who never found their way.

Not only will you help them,
discover their health and universal wisdom.

But like a true saint, you will extend their lives,
and help them to inspire others.
