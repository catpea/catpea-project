I once wrote a poem about an owl that tried to peck me,
and while it is one of my funniest poems, it is kind of real.

I actually return in my memories to that night,
because it was beautiful, warm, fragrant, and at first calm.

In an about that time, I was described as having swagger,
I certainly had multiple fanny packs, of which I was proud of.

And it was a large group of American Scouts,
and they don’t lie.

Any real adventurer, from tomb raider, archaeologist, bull fighter,
to a bonfire sausage aficionado like myself, needs to dress the part.

And I can never stress enough, that a proper adventurer,
requires a large knife, sausage shrink wrap won’t open it self.

And you always need to be real mindful of the brown bear,
the back bear is just a big raccoon.

But the brown bear, requires you to bear one of your arms,
all the way up to the shoulder, it is true that they are large.

But they can’t turn around to bite you,
when you are turning right around with them.

But you know, I’ve been to the Baltic Sea, the Atlantic Ocean,
and Florida Keys, and I got to tell you, it is the atmosphere.

The Baltic Sea is ancient and beautiful,
but somehow, there is always a stand all too near selling delicios smoked flounder.

The Atlantic is as busy, and hasty as New York City,
down in Florida Keys is nice, much slower, but also busy.

Lake Michigan, over at Ludington or Nordhouse, is much different,
it has been left alone by the world, Nordhouse is a tiny Wilderness.

It is a healthy place,
that exists at the natural pace of nature, as universe intended.

If any owl is to confuse your hair bun,
with a delicious crunchy little gerbil.

Or as it was in my case -
tries to peck you.

Nordhouse, is where it will all go down,
without a doubt.

The deer at the State Park are tame,
coyotes are handsome and well mannered.

The back bear population appreciates humans,
as people care about them, bears are adorable.

The porcupines, are the Peacocks of Nordhouse,
and just as large and calm, emanating an ancient wisdom.

Luckily there are no Brown Bears,
so you don’t have to practice any rectal palpation war techniques.

The most common animal at Nordhouse and even the State Park,
and also my most beloved, is the ever beautifully attired Seagul.

They are the heart and soul of the endless Beaches,
and most introspective and calm of the wild creatures.

They know humans well, they know when they are sad or lonely,
or have an extra french fry, and will gently come over to say Hello.

They’ll warn you of any rain, alert you to the Snake, Eagle and Hawk,
and above all, check up on you every once in a while.

The nicest bird, such manners,
the nicest.

I must confess, I have never been to Nordhouse in winter,
I am far too jelous to watch Winter at Nordhouse videos.

So when it snows where I am at, I sometimes wonder,
what it would be like to stay at Nordhouse, when it is cold.

And by extension, whether the lake freezes,
if it is just floating icicles, or hard and tough ice.

If you ever go visit Michigan’s Nordhouse, Winter or Summer,
count on adventure, and know that it will be precious, gentle, and beautiful
