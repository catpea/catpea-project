Early warm weather, they foretold,
and yet - I am sitting here - and I am really cold.

I am now convinced the groundhogs are sus,
I think they are making fun of us.

---

We had two days that were nice,
that felt like real paradise.

And then it started snowing,
followed by cold wind blowing.

I am really cold,
I can't believe we got trolled.

---

When I was told we don't have to wait until may.
I put all my winter clothes away.

And they didn't even fit me anymore,
as I've turned my gym into a dance floor.

In preparation for that early Spring,
I became a fitness king.

I burned up my fat,
my stomach is really flat.

But now, like a Chihuahua I shiver every day,
worried that it is going to be cold well into May.

---

And what are we going to do,
if their predictions are no longer true.

If the groundhogs are not our friends,
did they make any demands?

Should we deport them and build a wall,
something really pointy and tall.

Should we have a Cat-Dog Day instead,
and what would they predict? How long to say in bed?

---

I am really serious right now,
we really need to fix this somehow.
