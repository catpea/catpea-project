Cat Owners Beware: Hunter’s Moon May Earn You A Scare
Saturday • October 28th 2023 • 11:05:52 pm

No house cat is a rookie,
when it comes to being thoootally spookie.

And Hunter’s moon proximity to Halloween is a ticket,
for you cat, to get lovably wicked.

---

And you __will__ be right,
thinking that your cat mumbles at night.

Come Halloween’s nightfall,
you are sure to hear a cat call.

That is the anthem,
of the great cat phantom.

It __is__ the full moon,
that demands this tune.

All the cats will quietly growl at night,
a howl done right.

And before they retire, they always smile,
in that Cheshire style.

---

And before you ask,
nobody knows why they perform this ritual task.

We do know that they are serious,
but not why, they are being so silly and mysterious.

As always what matters the most,
is that cats truly appreciate us, at no cost.

And they have that magical ability to take away fright,
to in their kindness and generosity bring us light.

---

So yes, Halloween and Hunter's Moon,
may mean that your kitty will cause trouble soon.

Therefore, take this advice,
and be extra nice:

Come hunter’s moon,
be sure, to feed your kitty extra soon-soon.
