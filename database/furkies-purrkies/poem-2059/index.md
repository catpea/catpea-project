Knight’s Chivalry, the Lady and Gentleman Virtues, and now Rising To Greatness,
is your only winning move against parasites.

When you choose religion, a life that is part fantasy that calms you,
two generations down the road your family becomes says prey for liars.

The hard and unforgiving truth, is that, that apple does spoil the bunch,
exposed, without greatness, wisdom, and hard earned comprehension.

Your grand-kids begin tolerating fake education, for good grades,
and two generations from that, the liars will manufacture workers and soldiers.

The parasites will lift themselves up so height, that they will deny love exists,
and make it a crime to say that they pass excrement.

They will tolerate mass rapes and burnings to acquire land,
and make thinking a crime punishable by deate.

Knight’s Chivalry, and the Lady and Gentleman Virtues,
are a preventative measure that makes manipulations stand out.

What you think is fighting in a war,
begins with you destroying the enemy’s undesirables, those who want peace.

A war cannot be won,
it is always there for the profit of those.

---

By becoming ennobled by your deeds, by growing all the way up,
until you become a great being.

You gain the ability to see into the minds of the parasites,
just like mothers who can see when their naughty lie.

The gentle in Gentleman,
means ennobled.

The words Lady And The Gentleman,
mark those who are ennobled by their deeds.

Who have grown in wisdom, and understood,
that in a compromise between good and evil, only evil can profit.

Rise and rise again,
until the sheep become Lions.

May you play no part in plunging the world,
into another thosand years of darkness.
