Yes, it is pretty weird, though it isn’t complicated,
however, the overall effort is about trance, not just focus.

Trance is what you do on your way home from work,
you don’t have a complete memory because noting ruined your focus.

As a result, your perception of time,
jumped forward.

---

Let me make something clear to you right now,
a three hour workout without trance, can feel as long as almost 27 hours.

You get into a trance,
by moving to the beats of your music.

No one can, workout well without nice crisp and interesting music,
that plays at the precise beats per second, BPM.

A beat that you can handle in your current condition,
at your current weight of dumbbells.

When you go up in dumbbell weight, from 5lb per hand, to 7.5lb per hand,
you have to drop down the BPM of your songs.

In a word,
switch to 90’s country music.

---

If the songs are too fast, they’ll knock you out of your trance,
you’ll get to a point where you just can’t lift fast enough.

If you can’t synchronize your motion with beats of your songs,
you will never enter the trance, and your workout will become a chore.

A focused, entranced workout,
is normally the goofiest part of your day.

And of course you dance,
that is what synchronizing your motion to the beats of songs will do to you.

Country, is all organic moves, and more than that,
it is a subtle, almost covert, form of gymnastics.

It repairs and strengthens you back,
it repairs your body.

Dancing country especially with dumbbells in hands,
is more beneficial than lifting heavy for 45 seconds, and sitting for 10 minutes.

It is a superior workout,
to what most people do at the gym today.

---

You can’t lift 7.5 pounds per hand, at the same song BPM,
that you lifted your 5 pounds for.

Before you can eurodance with your new 7.5 pounds,
you have to line dance, so that your body completes the adaptation process.

Your muscles grow very rapidly as you go up in dumbbell weight,
but speed comes from lifting the same weight for a long time.

When 7.5 pounds is new to your musculature,
you can only lift at country song speeds.

---

Once your beats match your lifting ability,
one beat up, next beat down, you slip into that driving trance.

And even a three hour workout,
shrinks to 10 minutes.

---

There are many microscopic weird litte happenings,
that will pull you out of dance trance, you have to learn to avoid them.

I need you to understand, you might have never experienced trance,
because you have been tolerating these microscopic distractions.

---

And you absolutley need focus,
to enter the dance trance.

If you don’t enter the dance trance,
you will not be able to work out.

It will be too long,
too boring.

---

Your songs also have an expiration date, where the dance energy,
just goes away, and you can no longer flex and wobble to the sounds.

Once you deplete a song of energy,
it too becomes a little boring distraction, that you have to get rid off.

It takes years for the good songs to recharge,
mediocre songs deplete permanently.

---

You may remember form old kung-fu movies,
that there is talk about being calm like water.

They are talking about focus and trance,
even though the movie director can misinterpreter that.

But a busy gym will keep you in trance,
so as long as everybody is doing gym things.

---

When distractions come, there is no uniform solution, I recommend moving away,
and if the disruption continues: turn the frown upside down, leave early.

Let the distractions, bloom, into you giving your body,
more time to heal, more time to adapt.

---

Finally, your greatest distraction is counting sets and reps,
as there is no such thing, it is a workout myth that destroys workouts.

Even when transitioning to beats of music, and using song landmarks,
you will be distracting yourself with “when?”

To initially stop caring about time, you need a cheap off-brand interval timer,
with a strong vibrate function, stronger than a smartphone.

An interval timer is a stop watch, with two consecutive countdowns,
and a number of rounds, counting down the countdowns.

An you clip it on your belt,
so you can feel the vibrations.

Free apps exist that beep over your music, probably,
but I don’t recommend bringing a phone to the gym.

The first countdown is your workout duration,
the second if your rest, the rounds dictate how many workout-rest pairs you do.

The timers eliminate you asking yourself when to start lifting,
when to start resting, a question that puls you out of your trance.

The ultimate aim of ain interval timer,
is you very slowly eliminating all the rest periods.

To have a straight through workouts,
then you file the timer away in the kitchen drawer with other junk.

---

If you can eliminate all the microscopic distrations,
you will drop into a dance trance, from moving to beats of songs.

And that,
will make your hour long workouts feel like minutes.
