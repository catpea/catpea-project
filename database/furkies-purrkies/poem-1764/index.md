The Great Human Culture is a melange of wisdom, class and ideas,
of all the great beings that came before you.

They mean to deliver your intellectual inheritance,
the common culture, is often just side-loaded and will have you loop around.

---

You are meant to learn to no end,
and grow all the way up until you become a great and dignified being.

You are not a worker, you are not expendable, replaceable, ugly,
and especially, you are not poor.

Poverty is an tool used by false leaders and mediocre men,
to power a low effort economy, it is their own problem, not yours.

And perhaps above all, you are not unintelligent, or not as smart as others,
schools are not teaching, memorization is a shallow mockery of educaion.

They are just ineffective, make believe churches of education,
where you are sold an impression of knowledge.

They exist to rob you,
because you believe in them.

---

Comprehension is self taught, it is your very own network and clockwork,
of personal observations that you gain through private curiosity and exploration.

Real education comes from the deepest depths within you,
standardized education and universities are an insult.

Many elderly are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt,
think about that, and think about that saying a sucker is born every minute.

That is the number one reason why you must grow up fast,
you want to get ahead of the people expecting to exploit you for paychecks.

---

We don’t have much in the way of a guaranteed career today,
everything, is hinged on luck, and that is no way to treat your older self.

Therefore, you have to learn programming, begin with JavaScript,
writing for the browser, browser based desktop applications, and server side run-times.

With the help of AI it takes a few months,
you will learn things no teacher could teach you.

Sell, Desktop Applications and Web Browser Extensions,
because they do not require servers and thus up-front investment.

That is a future, you can visualize, and depend on,
if you can’t see something more clearly, welcome to the world of ECMAScript.

---

Learn programming, even if that isn’t something you want to do in the future,
as it will help you differentiate between real and fake educaion.

As a programmer everything you learn makes you more powerful,
and you can prove it by creating more powerful computer programs.

That is not the case with standardized education,
your memorization is temporary, GPA meaningless, and you have no powers.

---

Now listen here, especially if you are young,
books are not meant to be read, they are meant to be [heard][1].

But, you can’t hear anything, when adults are constantly lying to you,
and manipulating you, and sometimes even regretting you.

When you are hurt, you will be able to hear a book,
and in fact the wisdom will just transfer into you.

But what you need is adventure, great adventure,
epic adventure, which also happens to be your real graduation.

You are never too young to learn camping, survival, and hiking,
especially now, that you have been challenged to cross the Triple Crown.

The Application, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide Trails, in US,
the quest will take you either a lifetime of section hiking.

Or two years, of through hiking, and then a lifetime of returns,
to all the most beautiful parts.

Nature must stand as a constant in your life,
as that is the only detoxification that will open your mind to wise books.

Programming, Philosophy & Adventure, and do not forget,
you are to grow all the way up, so that you stand as a great being, and guide.
