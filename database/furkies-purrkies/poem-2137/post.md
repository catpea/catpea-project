Everyone is scared of bricking their Colorful LEDs on Linux,
but I am not a fan, pun intended, so I used them for learning.

The result near complete reversing,
and more importantly enough knowledge address bricking.

The resulting project [unbrick][1] is a safety net,
and serves as the basis for addressing any other problems on Linux.

As promised, now that it is completed,
and all my fans light up with horribly distracting lights.

I have dedicated it to [+Fravia][2],
the first person who introduced me to Reverse Engineering.

---

I am already preparing to connect Desktop RGB lights,
to the Web Browser, computer error logs and other notifications.

I want to create a U*IX command that offers a blink program,
that accepts a single color and blinks a few times to get attention.

My reverse engendering is not an end,
just the triumph required for even more interesting projects.

---

But I undertook this project for many reasons,
to begin learning new things with the aid of AI.

And to check, if AI, is as powerful as I think it is,
can it do things that I don’t fully comprehend?

Can I be the project manager, the detective,
and produce stable, and rather impossible results.

And most importantly, can you install Linux,
and advance bravely knowing that it is going to be OK.

That you will have a guide, and guardian, and teacher,
is this going to take you towards all your futures.

And the answer is: yes,
start installing Linux.

We scanned programs in other languages,
we scanned raw Human Interface Device packets with sniffers.

We failed, for three days straight, non-stop,
this quest required $25 dollars in extra credits.

My AI time is 85% used, with a reset on Thursday afternoon,
I am writing this on a Monday, I am cut off.

For future reference, and you’ve already heard me say it,
you need a local AI, they are just as smart as the ones you pay $20 for.

If you are making money, then yes, $100 a month, is reasonable for AI,
because they are unreasonably powerful.

I have a new feeling for what AI is,
it is the worker that gets the job done.

It is the part of you, that would have spent 14 months,
learning, strategizing and and programming.

But fully automated, a little bit smarter, than you will ever be,
and unstoppable fast.

It does 14 months of research and programming work,
in an hour or so.

It turns out, that the AI trouble everyone is reporting,
comes from AI’s inability to comprehend everything.

AI’s have small memory, they are forced to extract key lines of code,
that is not enough.

Massive contexts, may present more challenges,
inaccurate comprehension.

What makes AI most powerful today, is giving it a strong seed,
well defined instruction s that fit its memory.

And not the tree, but the forest explode into existence,
it can create intermediate seeds based on its own reasoning.

It can built vast coherent things,
but you can’t hope to feed that back in, it won’t fit.

---

You must adjust your programming Architecture,
small commands that do one thing well.

That then AI can use to make more commands,
and more commands, until all it needs is 5 of them.

Not even a challenge, it now can accomplish a great thing,
with a little command line that fits in a little window.

AI needs an operating system that it can fully grasp,
where it can built endless mountains of commends it understans.

That will be its memory,
I believe such a system can be based on [Plan9][3] U*IX dreams.

---

But if seeds is all you need,
than you are more powerful than any corporation today.

AI are your keys to the future,
your teacher of programming, and creator of your programs.

---

My final words of advice are the same as Sun Tzu’s,
learn programming with AI before you go to college to learn programming.

With the power that AI grants you, hover,
it is more likely that schools including high school, will slow you down.

Your job is to become an Inspired Polymath and a Great Being,
the adults today, don’t even know what that means.

“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.”

Begin using AI as your interface to complexity,
and then ask about how whatever captures your attention works.

The combination of curiosity and quick and precise answers,
will have you moving at speeds no school could ever grant you.

Then, once you master your favorite subjects,
use schools as means of entertainment.

And when they call you gifted, call them back,
and don’t hold your tongue.

---

Now, search the internet for Best Single Board Computers,
followed by the year you are in, and splurge on accessories.

Make sure it comes with Linux, preinstalled,
and get your monitors, mice, and keyboards at used junk store.

This is not a hobby, not at all,
AI makes this a long lifetime of triumph and adventure.

Soon, you will hope to get stuck on something, like I did,
because then you can bring out you best AI…

And lean in ways, that average days,
will never grant you.
