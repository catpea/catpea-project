Weighted Country Aerobics: A Beautiful Fitness Multiplier For Ladies
Tuesday • June 3rd 2025 • 9:30:53 pm

As you might have guessed 1980 Dance Aerobics is how bodybuilding is done,
you start with 3 pounds in each hand for one hour.

When your body adapts to 3 pounds, you start mixing in 5 pounds per hand,
for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, until you are able to dance with 5 pounds.

You repeat the process,
moving up by no more than 2.5 pounds.

And you have the option to manipulate the speed of your music,
or the length of your stay, you can add extra 30 minutes or double your stay.

The faster you move, the more stored energy reserves you use,
the heavier you lift, the greater your muscles.

Why boys are doing 3 sets of 10, and on various machines,
that can only slow them down.

Because they don’t want to stick out,
they are copying each other.

While I hope the following guess is incorrect,
we must consider that the myth of 3 sets of 10.

Came not from someone who did it right,
but from a camera man filming bodybuilders.

He would have said “Can you lift it 10 times,”,
and we’ll get the footage from three angles as not to bother you again.

That is how infective 3 sets of 10 are,
any results that people report…

Simply come from the fact, that they moved from the couch,
to doing something wrong, just doing anything will grow some muscle.

But, of course, it won’t keep growing them,
because moving from not lifting, to lifting it wrong, can only occur once.

I needed to tell you about this, to get your attention,
to underline the importance of what you are about to say next.

Dance has a shape, Shuffle Dancing or Cutting Shapes is jagged,
it is a snappy form of motion, hard on your knees and ankles.

There is a special kind of dance, that has evolved to help hard working people,
increase their flexibility, put on muscle, and protect their knees and ankles.

The same people, have invented the perfect bodybuilding diet,
because their lives depended on it.

And the form of dancing they proactive, isn’t jagged,
but rounded, protective, add progressively heavier dumbbells.

And you will have muscles, so balanced and magnificent,
no one will be able to compete against you.

Please, believe me when I say this,
I am speaking about the American Farmer, the Cowgirls and Cowboys.

[Country music][1],
from in and around year 2000.

It protects your joins,
and at its slower speed compared to Shuffle Dancing…

It pushes you to control the dumbbells with more precision,
winch combined with the broad motion dance enhances your entire musculature.

---

[Combine 1980’s aerobics with turn of the century Country][2],
and farmer diet, and you will multiply your results.

While looking beautiful,
and maybe even wearing a hat to protect your eyes from the overhead lamps.

Don’t take my word for it, think about it,
try a song or two, what I said will all make sense.

And as promised,
look absolutely beautiful.
