This morn, to my delight,
I saw her in flight.

It was wet and cold,
but she flew hard and bold.

It was raining frost,
all the drivers looked lost.

Her kind is rare,
a lonesome bird in the air.

Flying around the world,
right up until sheâ€™s too old.

---

Intelligence is weird,
it just appeared.

Some creatures get it too,
and this is what they do.

They try to understand,
me and you.

They see the weather,
and that we share the world together.

They see the poor,
the leaders, the immature,

They know social hierarchy,
despise oligarchy.

---

You may ask,
what is the purpose, the task?

What an a bird brain do?
Well, it will shame you.

---

The politicians that keep you poor,
that demand you endure...

In their ignorance are using you,
to push the economy through.

Animals have ways of seeing,
of appreciating well-being.

She can feel in her own lung,
that our species is young.

Bringing warm weather to January,
makes us very scary.

She knows us better than we think,
that we will take her, to the brink.

---

She also knows that we too can rise,
so as long as we each aim to become wise.
