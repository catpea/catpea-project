### The Jumblies By Edward Lear, 1846


    They went to sea in a Sieve, they did,
      In a Sieve they went to sea:
    In spite of all their friends could say,
    On a winter’s morn, on a stormy day,
      In a Sieve they went to sea!
    And when the Sieve turned round and round,
    And every one cried, ‘You’ll all be drowned!’
    They called aloud, ‘Our Sieve ain’t big,
    But we don’t care a button! we don’t care a fig!
      In a Sieve we’ll go to sea!’
         Far and few, far and few,
            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
         Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
            And they went to sea in a Sieve.


    II

    They sailed away in a Sieve, they did,
      In a Sieve they sailed so fast,
    With only a beautiful pea-green veil
    Tied with a riband by way of a sail,
      To a small tobacco-pipe mast;
    And every one said, who saw them go,
    ‘O won’t they be soon upset, you know!
    For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long,
    And happen what may, it’s extremely wrong
      In a Sieve to sail so fast!’
         Far and few, far and few,
            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
         Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
            And they went to sea in a Sieve.

    The water it soon came in, it did,
      The water it soon came in;
    So to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet
    In a pinky paper all folded neat,
      And they fastened it down with a pin.
    And they passed the night in a crockery-jar,
    And each of them said, ‘How wise we are!
    Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,
    Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,
      While round in our Sieve we spin!’
         Far and few, far and few,
            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
         Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
            And they went to sea in a Sieve.


    IV

    And all night long they sailed away;
      And when the sun went down,
    They whistled and warbled a moony song
    To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,
      In the shade of the mountains brown.
    ‘O Timballo! How happy we are,
    When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar,
    And all night long in the moonlight pale,
    We sail ...

...ught a cloak,
    And every day a cigar I’ll smoke,
        All to follow my own dear true
        Love of a Kangaroo!’


    V

    Said the Kangaroo, ‘I’m ready!
        All in the moonlight pale;
    But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!
        And quite at the end of my tail!’
    So away they went with a hop and a bound,
    And they hopped the whole world three times round;
        And who so happy,—O who,
        As the Duck and the Kangaroo?.
