Don't fall into the trap of explaining why,

just start building the new schools, forget the old.

The new schools are amazing,

because they are about happiness.

Seriously, you go there,

and you pick a classroom that makes you smile the most.

This is not an easy task,

because once you pick up some information here...

...then you want to go over there,

and when you get there...

...you'll see everyone scooting over,

elsewhere...

...all the while,

your face stars hurting from the smiling.

Lyke,

what the heck.

See, there is no Biology,

you never freaking learn about the powerhouse of the cell.

There is a series of presentations, about [Anti-aging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvWtSUdOWVI),

a series or presentations about [Synthetic Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHIocNOHd7A).

And all the older kids seem to be really into [Astrobiology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EszGIvRdgTE),

and then there is a lab that is heavily into Practical Applications with [CRISPR 3.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhjPd4uNFY)

Same applies to everything else, you won't find Music for example,

you'll find [Instrument Making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46w99bZ3W_M), or Song Publishing, and Building a Music Label which includes getting help with [Start-up Accelerators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk).

Don't fall into the trap of explaining why schools are bad,

just start building, keep moving forward, don't look back.
