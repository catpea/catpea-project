Where, sometimes, we all belong,

and where life is very, very, very, very, long.

As it winds along the well worn paths like a little song,

and where there is always a right, that can fix a wrong.

And we are hardly ever alone, so as long as we stand strong,

and you can achieve anything so as long as your effort is lifelong.

Many others traveled all these sandy roads,

many handled much more weight and greater workloads.

But it really all revolves about how much you learn, love, and know,

that's what helps you get unstuck from that rainy office window.

We don't have to ride every crazy rodeo,

live beneath an angry grumbling volcano.

Run as if chased by herds of stampeding buffalo,

and like every corner hides a foe.

Beautifully... it is best to live life slow,

in tune with crickets, starry nights, frogs and rain, sunshine, and snow.

Live so slow as to have time to learn, think, and write,

to share with others all that you found to be lovely and bright.

And not knowing what to write about, is the best,

because that means Nordhouse is calling you, to a little quest.

And when you return, you will have to find a warm and cozy nook,

grab a mug of chocolate and let your poems flow into your litte book.

Yup, you may need to pack a back pack, and give it a go,

remember, life is longest, when you live it slow.
