You are never too old,
to break the mold.

In fact you may age all too quick,
unless you find your costume click.

And you don’t have to look silly,
you _should_ dress beautifully, really.

Halloween is not about escape,
but adding something cool like a cape.

I celebrate my Halloween at my gym,
where I try to become slim.

I only add a fluffy tail to my outfit,
and that is it.

Hare ladies have it figured out,
you don’t have to dress like an astronaut.

Nor should you aim to fully look like a kitty,
just add something new and pretty.

And if you always dress to kill,
then you must growl on your treadmill.

Sometimes people dress right out of cheer,
when Halloween is not even near.

I once saw a young lady working out with a woolen hat,
you only need a tiny bit more than that.

Maybe some boxing gloves,
or more accents she loves.

Another time a man would arrive wearing a cloak,
like old timely London folk.

His dad put him through college,
he graduated with all kinds of knowledge.

And he started wearing a cloak,
to him it was serious and no joke.

He’d go to the locker room and change,
without thinking anything was strange.

I saw a couple of people in a green shirt and purple pants,
hulking weight with their hands.

We also had a hipster come in and sit for a while,
he never returned, and left without a smile.

That is how I will eventually dress,
I just need to make more progress.

And I am well on track,
to become a mighty lumberjack.

A good costume is delicate and witty,
and makes you look a bit more pretty.

It is subtle and light,
and above all fells right.

It won’t make you look immature,
that is for sure.

It is being serious and not dressing at all,
that makes you a neanderthal.

When Halloween is near,
you dress to show your cheer.
