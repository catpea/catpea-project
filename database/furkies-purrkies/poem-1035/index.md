My first cruel teacher,
was a vile and fearsome creature.

Unable to teach she forced me to pretend,
by frightening me to no end.

All she wanted to do is cheat,
just to make her ends meet.

If all a teacher does is pretend,
then their existence is always at an end.

And when she caught me reading a book,
and tried to give me a knowing look.

I didnâ€™t care to become her pet,
all that damned place taught me, was regret.

The whole school was fake an unfair,
and I hated being there.

And school is not a test for a job,
not when all that companies do, is rob.

School is mean to be real and profound,
it is place where much of wisdom is found.

It sometimes seems that nobody knows,
that a human learns the way a flower grows.

Nobody can tell you what books to read,
because it is not a list that you need.

We must all follow the colorful signs,
that our curiosities hope to turn into life-long-lines.

Only an environment of serenity and peace,
can make all the conflicts cease.

And learning for real,
is an enormously important deal.

Because if all we do is pretend,
then the world will end.

---

Each generation must be granted time and space,
to make our world a better place.

And this has nothing to do with the old days,
but rather with building wiser, and better ways.

The real tradition to aim for,
is to make the future better, and hold the door.

No matter what you are told,
please find a way to wisely help the world.
