You are a warrior,
and a warrior must venture out into the wild.

You are not a student, not a worker,
a warrior, you'll come homne some day, far in the future.

Until then, you will learn,
from books, and from adventure.

You are not a worker,
you are the hope and dream of humanity.

It is your duty to rise,
and rise all the way up.

---

If you never step away,
then your life will become unbalanced.

You will feel,
that there are things you want.

But they will fell, locked,
behind some glass door.

You will have your bicycle,
but neither time, nor energy.

You will want to become a programmer,
but every hour of your day will be taken.

You will have all the right books,
but you will not have the focus.

---

Unbalanced life,
is a kind of cruelty.

---

This ins not about balance,
with nature…

Not even with yourself,
yet.

It is about examining life,
and about knowing yourself.

You may never assume,
as then things may be taken from you.

You must always see,
and experience, and in wisdom.

---

This is not an invitation,
to be reckless, or do stupid things.

Not at all,
this about your dignity.

And nobility,
as a Human Being.

This is about you growing,
all the way up…

Until you become,
a great being.

---

What you don’t understand,
about adventure.

Is that the peace and silence,
and even a measure of boredom.

Triggers a forlorn health,
for books.

Today, narrated books,
free, from the libraries.

---

And it won’t be until,
mid-adventure…

That you will discover,
the great books are not about stories.

They are about pulling you into your culture,
the culture of heroes, the culture of greatness.

The story, is an excuse,
the message, is in what you learn of humanity.

What you learn,
of the great being you are meant to become.

And that is adventure,
and that, is your key.

The key,
that unlocks all the glass doors.

Greatness; the key,
that enables you to travel unlimited steps.

Child,
you mustn't deny yourself greatness,

You must live in harmony and peace,
with you elder self.

Rise,
rise to no end.
