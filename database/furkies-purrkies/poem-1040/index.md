I think everything is art,
and art makes us smart.

Little adventures were my first invention,
and they arose without any intention.

It was back when I wasn’t very tall,
I would look at the world through a keyhole.

And before long I grew,
and I knew what I had to do.

I grabbed some Christmas Tree candy,
as I knew they were going to come in handy,

Grandma made me sandwiches,
and went off to explore the world and its riches.

I probably didn’t get very far,
before I ate my last candy bar.

And I remember needing nap,
so my first adventure was over in a snap.

But it was my greatest work of art,
and it made me feel incredibly adult and smart.

It taught me to push everything away,
and make my own little way.

---

When I got to traditional art,
I wanted to start out super smart.

I projected my photos on a canvas or a wall,
and even created a comic by tracing a posable doll.

I reinvented [Camera Obscura][1] on my own,
today, you can connect a wall projector to your phone.

Often to look smart,
some people will hide how they do their art.

---

See, the world is bigger than what we see and hear,
and we must move forward without fear.

Humanity demands that we don’t just follow directions,
it asks us to make all the much needed corrections.

And to repair the mistakes out of reach,
we must become great beings and teach.
