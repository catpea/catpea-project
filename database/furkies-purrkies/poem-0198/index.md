It is pretty embarrassing to be born into a world

where our dear politicians pointed atomic weapons at each other,

and celebrated the peace; that this brought to the world.

---

I will say that with broken schools or fake education,

we can't really have the culture in which language can express:

No more war,

please, turn off the rockets.

---

But that also means, by means of abstract thinking,

we are able to comprehend the Power of Prevention and Education.

By creating a Powerful and Fun, Educational System,

we can Prevent Stupid Ideas from holding the world hostage.

Personally, I think that Self Education

is always going to be better than any Organized Education.

It is always at the right pace, and in the right sequence,

there nothing to stress about, it is just a really beautiful adventure.

Once we feel we know enough, we can begin scribbling,

like I am doing right now.

There is no better way to become a good writer,

than by writing.

And what a fantastic thing it is to be able to package

out most favorite thoughts into little poems,

that page by page, become little books we can share.
