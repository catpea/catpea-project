This will get a tiny bit dark,
but you need to understand that your future is your responsibility.

You must begin learning from clear thinking great beings,
as soon as possible.

Just listen to their narrated books,
and let their, culture transfer onto you.

Become a rebel, but go in the opposite direction,
take the harder right, rise to challenges Humanity faces.

And avoid the easier wrong,
as pretending to get an education can only ever take to the start.

You have already met the men who sold the world,
they are the teachers that trick you into inventing cramming.

This has been happening forever,
and it has destroyed everything.

When your back is turned some of the smartest people you know,
will chit chat about not feeling like an adult, not knowing what that is.

This i s because, a culture of ineducation,
necessarily becomes a culture of fake it until you make it.

A kind of a parody of real life,
where things tend to be simulated and make-believe.

This is right at the root of the that terrible Vonnegut quote:
“True terror is to wake up one morning and realize that your high school class is running the country”

---

Don’t count on adults, they’ll cheerfully legalize drugs,
hand you your first sample, and watch you destroy your life.

They won’t know what they are doing,
because they are just aged kids with fake education.

Most people don’t know what they have ruined,
once they cut themselves off from their future.

Fake wisdom, is such a dangerous territory,
that you just got to run in the opposite direction.

J. Maarten Troost reminds us that,
“If you hang around the barber shop long enough, sooner or later, you are going to get a haircut.”

---

Many bad ideas that are passed around, and blindly accepted,
just a handful of them combined, will cut you off from your future.

The only people you can rely on for your future are the Great Beings,
the Dreamers, Thinkers, and Philosophers that made the world better.

That stood up to mediocrity, and make believe grown ups,
and false leaders…

And just knew to say
“Listen here, you little shits.”

If you aim big,
try to become a career professional.

Then know that your schools will price their lowest common denominator lectures,
to rob you in broad daylight.

Their plan is to use you as a natural resource,
for as long as they can get away with it.

From college loans, car loans, home loans,
they’ll take so much, that they will impact your mind, drain you.

---

Your school to fight grade inflation,
divided your class in three, and graded all your classmates A, B, C.

No matter what they did, no matter how hard they tried,
C’s stayed C’s to keep the school under the radar.

Your teachers didn't care for a legacy,
they cared for paychecks.

Once they retire, they simply give themselves a legacy,
by saying “I was a teacher for X decades”.

Nobody ever asks what kind of a teacher,
or even if they won a best teacher award, whether they tried as hard the next year.

But you, you are not allowed to join in the big fantasy,
with Nuclear War back on the menu…

It only took a few decades for the make believe grownups,
to tarnish the names and sacrifices of real heroes who gave up everything for you.

You have to pick up, where the adults of today and yesteryear,
dropped the ball.

You don’t get to have stupid frat parties, or even care for grades,
you have to go to the library, and learn for real.

You have to re-discover the true human intellectual inheritance,
by tracing the development of the greatest non-religious clear thinkers across history.

Not all of them are going to wear a suit, and some will seem crazy,
and in fact, some of the greatest minds did unravel in the end.

And most of the philosophers went into hiding as writers,
Rand, Vonnegut, Bukowski, even Troost each hold a piece of the big puzzle.

And you have to lay your hands on their narrated books,
and take to adventure so that you can inhale them.

And most importantly, you need the culture of greatness,
which you inherit by befriending the authors.

Child, without the culture of greatness, nothing will work,
there will be no sense, no clarity, no backbone to anything.

Just the un-integrated, the unexamined, false celebrities,
manufactured intellectual leaders, implanted in some game of lies.

---

Get at all the most powerful narrated books,
and place their content above whatever your cool and hip teacher is regurgitating.

Do not delay, your entire future, all the things ahead of you,
are dictated by powerful authentic and functional wisdom and knowledge.

And even more important than that, you are not meant to be a worker,
you are meant to grow all the way up.

Poverty is a political failure, and facing it head on as it disintegrates you,
is not the right path, the world needs authentic leaders to fix it.

The world is not meant to spiral in a tried and true, predictable set of mistakes,
that turn a reliable profit, you are not meant to be a caged animal.

---

Rise, rise all the way up,
until you become a great being.

Now, is your time,
learn for real, do not delay,
