If you have to stop,
then it is too much.

When learning to jog,
you don’t stop, you walk.

When lifting dumbbells,
for shoulders, of biceps.

You don’t stop,
but switch to lighter dumbbells.

When dancing,
and needing to stop.

You switch,
to a slower song.

---

For other exercises,
like bench-press.

And machines,
that isolate muscle groups.

You can switch to,
another muscle group.

---

But there is a big problem here,
as isolation, is not that good.

When compared to
jogging or dancing with dumbbells.

One is a full body workout,
the other is a one muscle workout.

Choose an athletic body,
over just a muscle here and a muscle there.

All the cardio, flexing,
stretching is much healthier.

You can do better than
laying down in a gym.

---

When you lift too heavy,
you cut yourself off from finishing.

Getting shut down,
is not an a triumph, it is a failure.

---

Jogging or dancing is very important,
it burns your fat, and keep you flexible.

Laying down to have a chesty chest,
does not do much, relative to dancing.

Some popular exercises,
put you in danger of tearing a muscle.

Or hurting you back,
that is not a triumphant failure or noble risk.

Meaningful exercise must go on,
for the duration of your existence.

You work out as a teenager,
and in your middle age, and as an elderly.

Never stop your exercise,
thinking that you are too old.

Or that you can’t do it anymore,
you can, you just have to re-start gradually.

---

Your mind is that of a philosopher,
that always needs more narrated books.

But you body is an animal,
you can’t keep in a cage or a stable.

It needs to move, dance, jog,
feel crisp fresh air.

It needs new scenery,
dance, joy and laughter.

It does not need to be,
overwhelmed to stop.

It needs just enough,
to keep on prancing.

And gradually,
adapting to new fitness challenges.
