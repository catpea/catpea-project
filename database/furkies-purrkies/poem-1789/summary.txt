Bodybuilding: How To Lift For A Long Time? Or, Introduction To Interval Timers
Friday • January 24th 2025 • 12:37:16 am

You can find free interval timer apps,
or get a cheap no brand clip-on version.

An interval timer has two stop watches,
work and rest.

And a numeric countdown,
for the number of rounds that you can handle.

---

Warning: Interval timers are being used wrong,
their purpose, is to eliminate your rest periods.

It is not to create a routine that lets you stop,
and stick with it, as that is not how our bodies adapt.

Another Warning: Sets and Reps do not work,
it is a myth born out of Bodybuilders showing off.

And people lying, that they know how bodybuilding works,
but they don’t, sets and reps could not be more useless.

---

Lifting heavy for 30 seconds, if even that,
does very little for our bodies.

It just maintains the muscle we initially got,
after getting off the couch and showing up at the gym.

To grow muscle, you must constantly add to your workout,
and you can’t add anything to an exercise that cornered you.

Lifting so heavy,
that you can’t lift for any meaningful duration.

---

An interval timer, restores a workout,
taking it back from the liars and pretenders.

It changes you focus from lifting heavy,
to lifting whatever you can handle, for long.

---

You have to start at the beginning of the dumbbell rack,
with 3 pounds, maybe 5.

Learn [Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1], [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2],
and [Overhead Shoulder Press][3].

Play some 100-120 bpm range songs,
and get ready to lift to one beat, and lower to the next.

Use a regular stop watch,
to time how long you can lift your dumbbells for.

One minute, five minutes, whatever you can handle,
that is your work duration.

Now you have to get clever,
and figure out how long do you need to rest, to do it again.

That is your rest duration, you will have to adjust the two slightly,
to be able to handle 10 or 15 rounds of this to slow music.

---

And now, you begin your training phase,
it is is not working out yet.

Just like joggers,
you must first close your rest gaps.

Once you are able to workout non-stop for 45 minutes or an hour,
that will be the beginning of your real exercise routine.

You can leave your interval timer at home now,
and aim to lift heavier dumbbells, and then faster music.

And when yo are reary, add 15 to 30 minutes to your non-stop workout,
aiming to workout a minimum of two hours, five days a week.

---

See bodybuilding is quick and easy,
just got to give your body a chance to adapt with light dumbells.

And get rid of those darn rest gaps,
which almost seem to reset the entire exercise, making it meanigless.

---

Bottom line is this, if you lift your weights for 30 seconds,
just about only until you cut of your circulation.

You will get muscles,
no larger than what you need for 30 seconds.

But if you start lifting for two or three hours non-stop, every day,
always adding a pound or two, speeding up songs, or extending duration....

Your body will not stop adapting,
and continue growing.
