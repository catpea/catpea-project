The AI has made it so,
that you must give programming a go.

Because programming can set you free,
from poverty.

You were never meant to be poor,
you should never be told to endure.

All of that is side-loaded,
and can only be out coded.

You have to rise above all that,
and not let it crush you flat.

Th other careers take your money first,
and keep you coerced.

Learning to code is free,
and will help your mind grow like a tree.

You learn all the time,
without ever paying a dime.

Everyone finds something interesting code,
each coder walks their own road.

Learning to code is like learning to read,
it is something that we all need.

Despite what you might have been told,
it is a way to interact with the world.

It is not just about creation,
but also automation.

Connecting everything together,
with an invisible tether.

It is an art,
that makes you mighty and smart.

Each time you learn a new trick or tool,
you always become more powerful.

And you get really good at code,
when you take time to widen the road.

Learning tiny little machines,
and using them together behind the scenes.

Never program forward, instead,
always enhance the road ahead.

It only takes a little to enhance your powers,
often just a couple of hours.

The best way,
is learning a tiny bit every day.

And then your own program needs call to you,
and it becomes a game of what you can do.

By the time you are out of High School,
you are already powerful.

And now with Artificial Intelligence,
you have a way to beat school negligence.

Show them what it is like to learn for real,
and why it is such a big deal.

With AI you can go around schools,
and all their slow-poke rules.

With code you become free,
from poverty.

And with ideas that will coon come,
future becomes something you welcome.

Youâ€™ll want to build new stuff,
even if going gets tough.

It is really just complex play,
where you invent your own way.

Finally, whatever you create,
make sure that it is simple and light-weight.
