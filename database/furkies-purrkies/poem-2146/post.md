 Slowly walk back and forth, performing different standing dumbbell exercises in a repeating cycle. Letting different muscle groups involved get rest. Lift light, but not so light that you can lift more, and never so heavy that you are forced to stop. It is not about how heavy you lift, it is about how long you lift your heavy for.

 Your heavy the is the weight you can handle for a prolonged duration. I can’t tell you what that weight is. A farmer is going to be able to handle a higher weight than a watchmaker.

 Warning: if you are a farmer for example, then beginning a workout with three pound dumbbells, will be extremely discouraging, annoying, and feel worthless. Your starting weight is higher than three pounds.

 Warning: If you are a hot headed sun of a gun, you are able to lift more than your body can handle. If you go too fast, and disrespect the finely tuned machine and animal that your body is. You will get dehydrated, get a charlie horse in your legs, then in your back, and you will end up crawling to the bathroom. Don’t push yourself to the maximum, because maximum will push you back.

 You have to be able to handle your exercise well, and be respectful to your body. The most adapted person here is the woman jogger, who has the foresight to wear wrist weights in preparation.

 Jogging is a massive head start because it prepares your body for an hour’s worth of dancing. This is called endurance. All bodybuilding should begin with jogging for one hour. Skipping this part in favor of trimming rest-period on interval timers, is just unfair to yourself.

 And three pound wrist-weights (one on each wrist) is how you actually do bodybuilding. And proof of that are the muscular legs of a large man. The leg press cannot reproduce what obesity or wisely weighted long term weight vest can grant.

 Once you are cycling your dumbbell exercise for 45 minutes or one hour, non stop. Though you get a water-break, and you should put the weights down between songs to let your hands rest. Dumbbell joggers don’t seem to need this, they are tough as heck. You are well on your way to level two.

 And level two, begins, when you discover that you can lift heavier dumbbells. You maybe able to go up by 5 pounds in the beginning. But 5 pounds is too much to cover, your body can only handle a 2.5 increase by hand, and even here you may need to mix in your old weight with the new one to rest a bit. If your gym does not have 7.5 and 12.5 and 17.5 dumbbells use 2.5 pound wrist weight. But be careful as that maybe considered external equipment, and you may need to hide it.

In short bodybuilding starts as 1980's aerobics,
but then as your body adapts to handel the weight, you increase it. And your body starts adaping again, and by growing new muscles.

 Finally, ladies, I am not one to tell you what not to do, but let me tell you s omething about myself. If a girl with large muscles and veins approached me, I would instantly go into panic mode. Have some restraint, the world need more joy, not fear.

 This actually happened once, an bodybuilder woman at my gym approached a man because he caught her eye, and he yelled at her “What do you want?”, she though he was a mean person. But, honestly he was just scared of her. Let that be a lesson to you.
