Schools are structured to demand [blind obedience][6],
you are threatened with being held back, unfixable GPA, no job, etc.

So that you pass state tests,
so that the school can stay in business.

All of this is very unfair,
because learning is what you already do.

Ineffective schools,
are just a way to make money.

But you still need to get to the real books,
all the books that are held in high esteem by all the worlds intellectuals.

As with everything else,
fake bestsellers are everywhere, that too is a way to make money.

But have to find the correct books,
the authentic life changing works…

That will help you to your inheritance,
all the best and most meaningful wisdom.

I wish I could tell you AdultEd is better,
or that switching a few times will help you find one that works.

But, it is safer, if you just center yourself,
find your narrated books at the local library, and let them speak their beauty.

Teachers often dislike their job, they dislike you,
they lie about teaching you, so that they just get paid.

My favorite example is the [screen projector in art class][1],
if the teacher wanted to teach you art.

You’d start your art class
by projecting selfies on big canvas.

Hand eye coordination is not a valid argument,
it is a preference that inflates your teachers ego.

Same with music,
[you’d start the class by making songs in lmms, it is simple][2].

You’d learn math by making p5.js screensavers,
and physics by making mages.

There is an easy on-ramp for everything,
but the teachers are only interested in pushing you through.

The threat of not having a High School diploma is a pretty good one,
but you are also extremely intelligent.

Get to the narrated books about effectiveness of education,
enter the culture of those authors.

And go talk to the principal,
the books will show you what questions to ask.

And understand that when they tell you you are gifted,
it is an attempt to transfer you out and shut you up.

---

I have some idea what you need to ask them,
both about [school][3], and about [politics][4].

But things change,
and often surface observations need more work.

And it has to be a student,
once you get the diploma, nobody will let you back in.

Becoming a teacher to change things will feel awful,
as everyone there will turn against you.

They call you exocentric,
and laugh at how stupid the hormone student are.

[The principal will tell you what grades to give to your students][5],
and [people in charge will block you][7].

It takes 10 narrated books to get started with the subject,
of ineffective education and why things are the way they are.

---

Don’t let ineffective education get to you,
read your own books, and witness with your own eyes.

Finally, you don’t have to rise up against infective education,
you just need to center yourself in the middle of all the world’s wisdom.

This will help you grow without getting scared,
your books will help you grow all the way up, until you become a great being.
