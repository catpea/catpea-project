The Queen Of Queens who never Bows To Kings,\
and a keeper of all the doggie things.

She who united squirrels, dogs and cats,\
and to this day encourages them to wear tiny little hats.

It is a golden age of pet fashion,\
and all should dress with a passion.

She herself is a true charmer,\
and rides on a little horse in golden armor.

And she truly deeply adores,\
her silly little horse.

At home she dresses in a pink sweater of wool,\
that makes her feel cozy and cheerful.

---

Other than the fact that she is larger than life,\
little is known about her private life.

Though today she works as scientist,\
and in her free time enjoys being an artist.

And of course her wonderful smile,\
lights up a room from the distance of a mile.

---

She often barks,\
deeply wise remarks.

She is fond of saying,\
that one should never stop playing.

That we should aim for joy and fun,\
and sometimes even go on a really short run.

---

Her favorite thing is laying in her nook,\
and listening to her favorite book.

Of course! she is a true literary connoisseur,\
and loves when Bill Brysonâ€™s books are read to her.
