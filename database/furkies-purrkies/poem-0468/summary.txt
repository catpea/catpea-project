Programming Is Not That Scary
Friday • June 11th 2021 • 7:05:56 pm

It depends where you start,

start someplace easy and neat.

[Modern web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ffUHK7o5yI) is a [mix of several technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78),

and each \_can\_ be [very overwhelming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-pCNqqUbfI), not to mention all together.

But the [web is unfortunately tough on all](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=programmer+burnout),

even hardcore programmers.

As a lead programmer, [you don't actually have to know a programming language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwbM63-LFD4),

[managing the creation of your program](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+become+a+program+manager), is [far more powerful than writing it yourself](https://www.fiverr.com/categories/programming-tech/web-programming-services/web-application?source=category_filters).

[Hosting on the web can involve a lot of complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8K-Rg_7Tbo),

and you probably don't want to rely on any company providing application-specific services...

With the exception of the [operating system you pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iox7fr7p5Hc),

and the [hosting company](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinodeCloudHosting).

And even with that, you already committed to [owning a web server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsh64rjnRas),

the moment your server goes online, there will be [automated tools scanning it for exploits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pJKBL9x6bY), and trying to guess the password.

---

The computers [scanning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4imIIKEK5gc) or trying to break into your server, by the way,

are hacked, they are the ones that the automated hacking programs already broke into.

Any other traffic will be coming from [Tor or VPN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8pCRMrbSl4) networks,

often times the location of the hacked server is obscured.

There is nothing you can do,

often there is nobody to care that their server got hacked.

The moment one gets shut down,

couple more will get hacked elsewhere,

Unless you want to run a [honeypot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WUaI2pNiPI) tracking those servers,

you probably don't want to program web applications unless it is something big.

[As far as we...

...w.youtube.com/watch?v=8YP_nOCO-4Q),

or [NW.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UsGnjPYxLU).

The big weakness of desktops,

is that there are three incompatible operating systems, electron and NW.js, are actually [cross platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWFUSxqMJic) and repair that problem.

You don't have to start Developing your application User Interface First,

learning programming relies on good ideas, not just what is possible, but also, what is good.

For example [Smalltalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLPiMl8XUKU) has a very consistent user interface that requires very little GUI programming,

it is a good idea to write the non-GUI core of your program first, at the very least, to make it easily testable.

If you do like complex architecture, a well thought out [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w) language can be useful,

even better if you use [Behavior Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuWEQsE7Hlo) that describes your program core in a readable subset of English.

This is a good place to mention [MobX and Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83v8cdvGfeA) and similar application state based approaches,

where high level actions modify a non GUI model of your application.

---

You shouldn't let programming become complicated, though,

look at [Apple's Siri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIn5DZU_NoA), it is just chat; or filling out forms one line at a time.

Siri combined with a program like [MUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzvqSVgc2t4),

can start keeping track of context of conversations and learn and become more intelligent.

---

Finally, I think the best type of a program is one that has two kind of users,

the end-user that enhance their program by making additional purchases, and plugin-creators that further expand your original program idea.

This isn't so much about creating something as toxic as in-game-purchases,

but rather developing the initial features of your program as if you were a third-party content creator.

Giving your program life from inside out,

all the way back from its most fundamental features.

This way you can upgrade your program, one board at a time,

like the [Ship of Theseus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVlIZJTwgyQ).
