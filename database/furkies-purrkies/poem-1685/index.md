Everyone is doing it wrong,
and the books are wrong.

Most people give up on fitness,
precisely due to bad advice.

What advice could I give you,
that could possibly change that?

The kind of advice,
that would be obvious to you.

Had you not received wrong advice,
which clouded your judgment.

---

Our bodies have special powers,
they are self renewing biological machines.

And just like you must follow rules of physics,
when you accelerate a car.

You must also slowly get your body,
to adapt to meaningful workouts.

If you copy athletes, or even gym rats,
you will fail.

You have to gradually,
get to where they are.

The same way they did,
whether they knew it or not.

---

If you ask someone how they did something,
that they merely stubbed into, they will lie.

If you copy bodybuilders from a documentary,
you need to account for the camera pointed at them.

And the fact that they are just showing off,
and like above, maybe making stuff up.

So stop listening to advice,
and begin paying attention to results.

---

Lot at a fat person, and ask yourself,
what is this magic that they use to get around.

They are dragging extra one or two hundred pounds,
something that would crush you.

How to these heavy people,
have this incredible power?

They have gradually gained weight,
giving their body time to grow muscle.

If they lose that fat,
they can gain speed and become powerful athletes.

But to keep that muscle, post weight loss,
they will need to wear a weight vest.

Wrist weights, ankle weights,
and move, keep on tricking.

---

If you are not large,
for you to successfully replicate their muscle.

You need to gradually, increase your weights,
otherwise that extra 100 or 200 pounds would stop you.

Gradually, but not as slow as gaining fat,
though not so fast, that you can t move and need rest.

---

Jogger have another piece of the puzzle,
no jogger, can originally just start jogging.

They will run out of breath,
and suck wind like a fat guy walking.

But, they have an incredible gift,
joggers do not believe it is jogging.

Unless they don’t need to stop,
it just makes sense to us and to them.

Jogging,
has a built-in wisdom.

Bodybuilding,
has a built in flaw.

It seems like big muscles,
demand big weights.

The formally fat bodybuilders,
who are lifting big weights.

Seem to serve as evidence,
backing this up.

But again, bodybuilders who were once fat,
gained their muscles from carrying all that fat around.

They may not know how they got their muscle,
and may say that it is genetics.

It gets even worse, as a lot of big muscle people,
are stuck in a plateau.

They lift so heavy,
that they simply cannot light heavier for long enough.

Especially, because gyms to save money,
will manufacture equipment spaced five or 10 pounds apart.

An increase of five pounds in a dumb bell,
is too much, tow and a half pounds is almost too much.

So it works like this, Mr. Fatty Fatterton,
starts with 20 pounds 50 times, that he can lift.

Because he lifted his fat all his life,
from the age of nine, or lower.

He loses some weight, goes to 25 and 30,
lifting 30 times.

And then 35 and 40,
lifting 15 times.

And 45,
10 times.

And he can’t lift 50,
for long enough, to adapt.

That is called a plateau,
because they don’t know what they are doing.

They will stay here,
not really growing muscle, maybe losing fat to gain definition.

But they will have cornered themselves,
they went to fast…

And now it is too heavy,
to move for long enough…

For the body to get a signal,
to adapt – and they stay at their plateau.

Sitting, sitting, and sitting,
sometimes getting up, and then sitting again.

But it gets even worse,
because they don’t want to be seen lifting 20 pounds again.

And it gets even worse,
because to break through their plateau…

They need to start lifting 5 pounds,
and they won’t feel a darn thing until 45 minutes in.

And it gets even worse,
because they have to sway and dance with 5 pounds weights.

Non stop for two hours,
inviting so much ridicule, and pain, that they will never do it, ever.

---

Joggers get a wisdom,
bodybuilders get a curse.

---

Joggers are not interested in bodybuilding,
but they get muscular without adding any weight

The machinery of their body,
becomes a symphony orchestra.

The very thing,
we evolved for.

Running fast,
to get around, to get away, and to chase down prey.

If they did add weights,
slowly enough not to stop.

In a reasonably short time,
they would safely become bodybuilders.

---

What can we do to lift the bodybuilding curse,
of sets, reps, sitting around, and plateaus.

Follow evidence of fast muscle growth,
that we can see with out own eyes.

There can only be success,
where there is evidence.

Bodybuilding,
is a weighted endurance sport.
