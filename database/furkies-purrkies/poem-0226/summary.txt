Back Row
Monday • October 12th 2020 • 6:19:41 pm

Do not drop out of High School,

the Back Row is a special place.

It is how the Universe asks for help,

you are being asked to watch for trouble.

To keep an eye on your bullies,

make sure they all come back from home.

Their violence is an expression of abuse,

there is nothing you can do.

You are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,

especially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.

And you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,

if someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.

Watch the [Security Guards](http://archive.cantonpl.org/observer/2000/02_Feb%202000/02-06-2000.pdf),

make sure that everyone is keeping a distance from all the students.

So, by now the teachers have you half way,

towards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.

They have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,

their [statistics can't stick out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY), they need a usual distribution of grades.

If it was all As, someone would come around asking why,

you are the "F" that makes their bullshit look legitimate.

I know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,

and now you don't have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.

But you are wrong.

Nobody else learned that stuff either,

even some of the kids that had tutors, didn't learn it, they just memorized it.

You'd have to be a freak of nature,

to actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don't memorize garbage.

Be careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:

"...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.

That dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.

It lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications."

You are just as smart as everybody else,

you are just as smart as Newton was before he started reading books he liked.

There are no gifted individuals,

but there are individuals who like being celebrated as g...
