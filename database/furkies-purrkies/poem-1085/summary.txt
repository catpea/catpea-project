What Artificial Intelligence Sees In Our Poems
Saturday • February 18th 2023 • 8:32:09 pm

This evening I asked a computer program to create a list of poems,
that help people wake up out of indoctrination.

And it found some patterns that would not be obvious,
to a person that is already set where the common meaning of those poems is concerned.

The poems you are about to hear came up first,
and I hope that you don't mind that I give a brief introduction to each.

It is all to easy, to lose ourselves to the meanings that aren't the highest to be found,
all of these poem talk about one thing.

Growing all the way up, until we all become great beings,
and converge on wisdom in world peace and end of poverty.


In my preparation for this poem this morning,
the AI also shared a quote by Mahatma Gandhi: "Poverty is the worst form of violence."

###

This first poem is about my America,
immigrants always have a have a stunning and undying vision of United States and the Developed World.

In fact, when I think about this nation, I don't thing about a chunk of land,
I think about the united states of the world.

To me this is the nation that learns to understand,
that criminals are simply indoctrinated into a life of crime and violence and already punished by the deathly squeeze of poverty.

I still believe that ours will be the first nation to help criminals to therapy, and real education,
and that we will be greatly ashamed by torture and prisons.

I further believe that United States will be first to implement,
an extremely powerful Universal Basic Income Program, that will end poverty.

From that point on, we will have the mind, that will help us realize,
we are not learning in schools, only pretending so that we can get a job; and then we will swiftly change education.


### The New Colossus By Emma Lazarus
An 1883 sonnet lines of which are engraved on pedestal of the Statue of Liberty

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
With silent lips. “Give me your tire...

...icket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.


### Finale

And that concludes the reading of this evening's poems,
but the list goes on.

Remember your first and foremost duty in life,
you are to grow all the way up, not part way, but all the way, until you become a great being.

That is the only way the world can follow,
we are each meant to become great beings.

“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...”

Kosmos

Who includes diversity and is Nature,
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,
Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,
Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,
Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.
