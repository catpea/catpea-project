The worst thing that can happen to you early on,
is you becoming tricked that you are not extremely intelligent.

---

Don't let schools trick you,
you still need a real education - it will unlock all your powers.

The closest we have to real education is self education,
by means of top 10,00 narrate books, and learning programming...

Towards creating a series of startups,
until one of them works out.

---

Even the physical education teacher doesn’t know what he is doing,
you build muscle by increasing your endurance, not lifting heavy.

It is an unspoken conspiracy, where everyone has a common aim,
that they don’t’ have to communicate, they just know how to play you.

The common aim is getting paid,
the game is selling you out for paychecks.

To show you why you can’t fix it very easily,
and certainly not by focusing at the heart of education, if it even has one.

I will use the prison industry as an example,
criminals aren’t aliens.

They are taught the wrong things about the world,
tortured with yelling, lies, humiliation, and then kept in cages in terror from other inmates and even gangs.

But there is nothing you can do, for one it is a multi billion dollar industry,
and business people with twisted minds will fight you.

You can’t convert prisons to schools and therapy centers,
which is what they should be.

And schools is just as impenetrable, fake and useless theater,
that aims to convert you into a paycheck.

Don’t try to fix schools, you will not win,
everyone sucking education dry of paychecks will turn against you.

---

One way to think about this,
is that the beautiful idea of education has been replaced by a parasite.

You need real schools, otherwise you will believe in the wrong things about the the world,
and above all, you will not have developed any talents.

Talent is not something you are born with, that too is fake,
everyone wants people to believe they are born special with supreme skills.

This is best demonstrated with this notion of photographic memory,
it is not real, it doesn’t exist, photographic memory is completely made up.

Genius is similar, no one is born a genius,
and we are all equally capable of becoming a genius.

Please understand, that the world genius, is a really stupid word,
used by stupid people to feel superior, such is the poverty of their mind.

Einstein, used natural phenomena like sound-waves,
or the train whistle.

I expect he put light on top of sound, until he discovered stretching of space-time,
to support his model of the universe, which turned out to be correct.

---

You are fully capable of reaching heights,
unseen before.

Fake education is the very damn thing that stands in your way,
it works exactly the same as religion.

You are taught to memorize things that plug your curiosity,
and as a result those curiosities get terminated.

---

If you go to art class, you will fail to become an artist,
to become an artist you have to use the projector above your fake teachers empty head.

Take a selfie, project it on a canvas,
and you won’t be able to stop, ever.

If you go to music class, that will mangle you,
the kids that make it, are those who have experienced tutors at home.

You can compose right now, just get LMMS,
[look a melody composition tutorial video][1], and visit [Learning Music][2].

You learn math from programming, [mathematical notation is a disgrace][3],
calculus and physics from programming 2D games, and selling them.

---

Which brings me to the final point,
your curiosities are not just plugged, and schools are not just fake.

You are under attack, by not learn for real,
the future ahead of you will be crushing, there will never be a light.

And even your retirement,
will turn out to be a con job.

Ineffective education is derailing you,
from your very own future, and pushing you into a 9-5 cubicle shit-show.

Programming, is the single most important subject,
it is so powerful, that it can peal mathematics like a banana, and eat it too.

You can already generate beautiful non-deterministic art,
and sell as designs, t-shirts or even mugs and kitchen magnets.

With programming, you get to automate the whole damn thing,
eventually as a programmer you could generate products based on customer’s searches.

But take a programming class in school,
and it will destroy it.

Don’t think of it as programming,
think of it as __automaton__, the ability to have your machines play a symphony for you.

Fake school is cheating you out of everything,
and then threatening you that you wont get a diploma, to work a soul-crushing office job.

---

You must regain control over your future,
and the most powerful choice you cam make today, is to binge on JavaScript programming tutorials.

This is important,
especially if you are just starting High School.

As a side project,
document how you are treated, and how fake the lectures are.

---


With video tutorials that you can pause, you will easily learn programming,
and it will be a heck of a lot of fun.

[I recommend learning node.js JavaScript programming][4],
and writing command line commands with the aid of the [commander module][5].

Commands are great for automation,
in fact, it can be said that commands are everything, because complexity sucks.

The thing about JavaScript is that you can use the same language on the server,
and in the browser.

In other languages, like python (that others will try to convince you to learn) you still need to know JavaScript to create your User Interface,
and you end up with the server code in one language, and browser code in another which is insance.

People who are critical of JavaScript Node.js and Electron,
are scared of it, because the ecosystem is huge, compared to their tiny little language.

JSON, HTML, CSS, Svelte, Mongo, Node, Electron, Commander, EventEmitter,
procedural programming, OOP, functional programming, sounds scary at first.

But JavaScript loves you, so as long as you stay away from TypeScript,
stay with the mainstream, don’t get tricked by the old extend, extinguish, and net new programmers funk.

TypeScript is a programmer grab, a way to make money,
it is not worth it, you will regret it.

---

Finally, schools are fake,
but you still need a real education.

You need to learn programming, music composition, digital and traditional painting,
and how to use artificial intelligence to build your little companies.

Don’t let people tell you that you are gifted,
don’t let them use the words “Balanced Education” that is part of the attack.

You need real education, effective education, that shows real and positive impact,
on the future of your existence.

Lastly, to grow up, means to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.
