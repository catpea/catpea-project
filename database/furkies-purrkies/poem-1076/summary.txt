Self Educate; Or, Don't Let Ineffective Schools Rob You Of Your Future
Thursday • February 9th 2023 • 10:30:54 pm

The worst thing that can happen to you early on,
is you becoming tricked that you are not extremely intelligent.

---

Don't let schools trick you,
you still need a real education - it will unlock all your powers.

The closest we have to real education is self education,
by means of top 10,00 narrate books, and learning programming...

Towards creating a series of startups,
until one of them works out.

---

Even the physical education teacher doesn’t know what he is doing,
you build muscle by increasing your endurance, not lifting heavy.

It is an unspoken conspiracy, where everyone has a common aim,
that they don’t’ have to communicate, they just know how to play you.

The common aim is getting paid,
the game is selling you out for paychecks.

To show you why you can’t fix it very easily,
and certainly not by focusing at the heart of education, if it even has one.

I will use the prison industry as an example,
criminals aren’t aliens.

They are taught the wrong things about the world,
tortured with yelling, lies, humiliation, and then kept in cages in terror from other inmates and even gangs.

But there is nothing you can do, for one it is a multi billion dollar industry,
and business people with twisted minds will fight you.

You can’t convert prisons to schools and therapy centers,
which is what they should be.

And schools is just as impenetrable, fake and useless theater,
that aims to convert you into a paycheck.

Don’t try to fix schools, you will not win,
everyone sucking education dry of paychecks will turn against you.

---

One way to think about this,
is that the beautiful idea of education has been replaced by a parasite.

You need real schools, otherwise you will believe in the wrong things about the the world,
and above all, you will not have developed any talents.

Talent is not something you are born with, that too is fake,
everyone wants people to believe they are born special with supreme skills.

This is best demonstrated with this notion of photographic memory,
it is not real, it doesn’t exist, photographic memory is completely made up.

Genius is similar, no one is born a genius,
and we are all equally capable of becoming a genius.

Please understand, that the world genius, is a really stupid word...

...orials.

This is important,
especially if you are just starting High School.

As a side project,
document how you are treated, and how fake the lectures are.

With video tutorials that you can pause, you will easily learn programming,
and it will be a heck of a lot of fun.

[I recommend learning node.js JavaScript programming][4],
and writing command line commands with the aid of the [commander module][5].

Commands are great for automation,
in fact, it can be said that commands are everything, because complexity sucks.

The thing about JavaScript is that you can use the same language on the server,
and in the browser.

In other languages, like python (that others will try to convince you to learn) you still need to know JavaScript to create your User Interface,
and you end up with the server code in one language, and browser code in another which is insance.

People who are critical of JavaScript Node.js and Electron,
are scared of it, because the ecosystem is huge, compared to their tiny little language.

JSON, HTML, CSS, Svelte, Mongo, Node, Electron, Commander, EventEmitter,
procedural programming, OOP, functional programming, sounds scary at first.

But JavaScript loves you, so as long as you stay away from TypeScript,
stay with the mainstream, don’t get tricked by the old extend, extinguish, and net new programmers funk.

TypeScript is a programmer grab, a way to make money,
it is not worth it, you will regret it.

---

Finally, schools are fake,
but you still need a real education.

You need to learn programming, music composition, digital and traditional painting,
and how to use artificial intelligence to build your little companies.

Don’t let people tell you that you are gifted,
don’t let them use the words “Balanced Education” that is part of the attack.

You need real education, effective education, that shows real and positive impact,
on the future of your existence.

Lastly, to grow up, means to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.
