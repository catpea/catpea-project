I have generated a very strange alien lady,
strange eyes, originally strange fingers, and a strange robotic bird companion.

It is true that I did not paint it,
but there is more to art than just painting it.

For one I saved it from the chaos of latent space,
inside these art generating models.

Not everyone likes strange art,
or even odd eyes.

Solara has taught me, great lessons,
I was able to practice [Krita’s Smart Patch Tool][1].

Something I never had time for,
but turned out to be critical for working with AI Art.

And it really is smart, once you select it,
just paint over the area you want gone.

Originally Solara had a cute egg on top of her head,
I painted over it, and it disappeared, needing but minimal brush work.

If you are new to Krita,
please you must get a art pen and tablet, for about $50.

The tip of the pen is pressure sensitive,
and is very important for blending colors.

As to the fact that AI is bad with hands,
you will need to purchase a wooden hand model.

The AI generators always give you all the right colors,
armed with a hand model, you can practice art.

But if you are just starting out,
or aren't interested in learning how to paint.

Then just avoid images that have hands in them,
don't waste your credits or GPU on trying to regenerate a perfect hand.

If you have time in life,
consider this a magnificent invitation into the new world of digital art.

And start practicing art,
by fixing AI generated hands.

Solara also helped me to discover [Resynthesizer][2],
this time a plugin for GIMP, a program similar to Krita (both are free)

And here I used UNCROP, where the resynthesizer,
expanded the image by a whopping %25 percent.

It required about a minute of work,
it is about as perfect as you can get without AI based synthesis.

AI plugins exist, but they require expensive video cards,
as they use them for calculations that are just too slow on a CPU.

Adding 12.5% of space around Solara,
allowed me to select a whopping 2.5 inch tall wrap-around canvas.

It is perfect, for a 40x40 inch canvas,
this piece does not require a frame, just hang it up and enjoy the strangeness.

I priced Solara at over a $1,000 dollars, though the store set it on sale at $990,
if a sale was ever made, my commission would be $500.

Printing and shipping a 40x40 inch frame,
probably shouldn't cost that much, I think their cut should be no more than a $100 dollars.

Which brings me to a very important point, and I’ve herd it made before,
and that is the purchase of an expensive canvas printer.

It probably costs 2,000 used, and does nothing,
for those beautifully warped canvas edges.

But if my art ever started selling, then I would just build my own frames,
and learn to stretch the printed canvas properly.

I’d love to ship everything in a round tube,
and let the customer put it together.

First they would assemble the square frame,
and then hook the canvas with elastic fasteners of some kind.

It is not just about assembly,
but also being able to roll the creation down and put it away, or re-sell it.

Know that your art does not need to cost double,
but it will take inventiveness, innovation, and trial and error.

The website I sell this on, allows re-configuring products,
so a customer can take down the wrap around frame thickness to 34/in.

And resize Solara to a reasonable 12x12 inches,
here the price goes way down to $150 dollars.

A paper 40x40 inch poster, costs $36 dollars,
a 12x12 resize is $9 dollars, and a 6x6 inches version is just $7 bucks.

At 6x6 inches you can get a frame for it at a dollar store,
for just one smackaroo.

Just to give you an idea of how much this costs,
I pay $30 dollars a month for the art generator.

But if you have a good computer,
you can get Stable Diffusion for free, the AI is open source.

But the computer,
needs to be a $4,000 gaming rig.

And I pay $60/year for an upscale,
which again would be free if you had a speedy computer.

Here you would use a program called,
[ChaiNNer][3], it is a lot simple to use than it looks, they have presets for upscaling.

The store I am testing all this at is free,
but it asks you to do your own advertising, which could cost a few dollars in ads.

That is it, $30 per month, $60 per year,
and potentially an ad campaign.

In closing, I would like to read the product description,
also written by free artificial intelligence.

And here I just wanted to clarify that Oumuamua is is an actual star ship like asteroid,
that suspiciously parked in our suns orbit and started accelerating, though scientists say it is just out gassing.

Solara From ʻOumuamua Canvas Print
$1,165.00 per canvas

Once upon a time, there was a visitor from another world. Her name was Solara and she had traveled to our solar system in a scout ship called ʻOumuamua. Solara was part of an advanced alien civilization that had developed a unique way of traversing the cosmos. Rather than using traditional propulsion methods, Solara's people had harnessed the power of already accelerated asteroids. They would hitch a ride on these speeding bodies, using their own technology to adjust course and speed as needed. In this way, they were able to traverse the vast distances of outer space in relative comfort and with minimal energy expenditure. Solara and her people had come to our solar system in search of knowledge and understanding. As they explored, they marveled at the wonders of our sun, planets, and moons. But their mission was not just for exploration. They also hope to share their unique knowledge with us, giving us the ability to stay forever young, so that we might one day join them in their infinite journeys through the stars.
