Don’t Stay Overweight; Use It To Become A Bodybuilder
Sunday • April 21st 2024 • 12:36:55 am

No, you did not pick bodybuilding,
but, yes, bodybuilding did pick you.

I am deeply sorry, and in fact hurting,
but I must continue to resist being nice in context of obesity.

The longer you wait,
the worse it gets.

What kind of a person would I be,
had I minced words about letting people stay hurt.

The impact of obesity is as dark as it gets,
it is a disorder, and a disease, and and early end.

But, listen, there is something good here,
something kind of amazing.

---

When you get the common cold,
and take days off and sleep late.

Your body benefits in many ways,
from that sleep, and rest, and extra vitamins.

You don’t see it,
because of your sniffles.

But take two weeks off to heal completely,
and you will not just return cured, but restored, rejuvenated.

---

Obesity is a much slower disease,
it works across decades not weeks.

But, just like the rejuvenation,
from resting due to a common cold.

There is a strange positive,
hiding here.

Obesity arises from your body storing food,
really good food, that really helps with bodybuilding.

Let me make that clear,
if you are fat you are almost a bodybuilder.

---

You probably think bodybuilding is shallow and stupid,
I mean lifting things is not exactly a challenge.

But, even though it is silly,
it is the cure to obesity, and aging.

Bodybuilding is an endurance sport,
and thus a powerful life extension technique.

---

So if you choose to end obesity now,
you will become muscular, and slow aging.

Slowing aging is a wise idea,
as life extension medicine and technologies will happen soon due to AI.

---

You probably know that protein,
help your muscles grow.

But are wondering,
how does stored fat help bodybuilding.

Stored fat is energy,
it helps you work out for long enough to out on muscle.

It helps you recover faster,
for more exercise.

---

Before we talk about the body,
lets talk mind.

---

Obesity is not exactly a mental disorder,
we should call it that, because it is an emergency.

Because obesity is a great danger,
to organs, self esteem, lifestyle, and life.

But the truth is,
we overeat to treat discomforts.

Overeating is not the cause,
it is a symptom.

You are going to have to,
remove the discomforts.

---

Life is beautiful,
you deserve that beauty.

...h a weight vest, maybe ankle weights.

See skinny people can‘t do that,
they will run out of energy.

But you can, because you have already stored,
the needed nutrition.

A skinny person has to force feed,
to keep up with the calories.

Where you can eat normally,
but you must avoid carbohydrates.

And eliminate all sugar,
search among sugar substitutes.

---

There is no such thing as sets and reps,
that is just a myth everyone is copying.

Bodybuilding is the same as jogging,
but you use your arms.

You only need dumbbells,
and you need to start with 3 pounds.

So you are just walking back and forth,
then you can dance a little.

And if you feel like it,
then you can go for a run with dumbbells in your hands.

I personally recommend shuffle dancing,
because you are not pounding your feet into concrete.

It is much easier on your knees,
plus, all the kind people will think you are pretty cool.

And the gym bros,
will leave you alone mistakenly thinking you are bonkers.

But they will not progress,
sets and reps induce a workout plateau.

Only non-stop lifting and moving with dumbbells,
for an hour or two, will ever work.

The couch to 5K shows you,
how to eliminate rest.

You can use a clip on interval timer too,
or time yourself with music.

Long song to workout, short song to rest,
until you don’t need to rest anymore.

---

So look at your obesity now,
it is not really a real mental disorder.

Is is that you are dealing with a lot,
and food brings comfort.

And in all the haste,
you didn’t realize it was killing you.

But now that you know,
you are allowed to become the black sheep.

You are allowed to disappoint everyone,
because you deserve to live a long life.

You are no longer the answer,
to other peoples problems.

You are now charged,
with growing all the way up…

Until you become a lover of wisdom,
a philosopher and a great being.

And as a bonus,
you become fit, muscular, and slow your aging to a crawl.

---

You also have a reason to dance,
daily.

And with all those muscles,
you have a reason to dress all fancy.

All the positive that you are facing, now,
can only beget more and more good things.

---

So while obesity is a curse,
every curse is also an advantage.

A reason to rise,
a reason, to make your own way.
