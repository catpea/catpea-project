The Human Culture Is A Culture Of Greatness, And Growing Up, Is For All
Thursday • April 13th 2023 • 10:48:14 pm

If you can think, and have a beating heart,
you must understand it through and through.

That you may not, and by authority of both,
all the future generations, and young people of today…

You may not, grow up a little bit,
or merely part way.

There are no exceptions,
beliefs do not matter here, growing up is for all.

Growing old, is irrelevant, it is something entirely different,
it is in-fact a privilege denied to many.

Growing up is about knowledge, adventure, experience,
the resulting wisdom, and a private personal rise to greatness.

---

No matter where we stand,
no mater how small or warped our views.

Growing up,
is not optional,

And it is a matter of The Human Culture,
which is a super-culture that we rise to with our greatness.

It is also a matter of class,
where we are kinder to teach other.

And it is a matter,
of leaving a beautiful legacy, that will be worth the while.

---

Your legacy must be lovely, and meaningful,
and I dare say it ought to make people smile from time to time.

It need not be narrations, or written text,
but you should really consider it.

---

Growing all the way, aside from your rise to greatness,
must result in works that call to the future generations.

That let the future have whatever goodness and wisdom,
you held dear, so that they may hope to resume where you left off.

---

I urge you to create or just imagine a narrated journal,
and work on it, until you know that there are others that would care to hear it.

Imaginary or not it will serve as measure of personal health,
and filling it with wisdom, adventure, and humor, will keep you rising to no end.
