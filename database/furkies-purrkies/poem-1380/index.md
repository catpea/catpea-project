It is exactly like building castles in the sand,
but here you can just keep on truckin’ forever.

Your programs, like good art,
are never finished.

And it is never about finishing,
it is always about learning.

---

First of all, being a programmer,
and working as a programmer, are two different things.

The jobs are fun, but they don’t create,
they don’t build, they don’t flow.

---

When you are not being distracted by work,
you are learning like some kind of a intergalactic titan.

You are always leaping over yourself,
surrounded by new capacities, abilities, tools, and spells, that you created.

You feel nothing but programmer rage (which is very artistic and high brow),
when looking at high school, and concepts like genius.

Experiencing real education,
exposes most of the lies, while multiplying your mind.

Programmers who hate programming exist,
but, I think just because the job pays too well to quit.

The moment programmers start their own thing,
programming is just Art, music, poetry, diagrams, dreams.

You need to find what your program is,
and then as you work on it more and more, you will fell your success coming.

My program is a standard visual programming language,
but it comes with a ton of stuff that makes it unique.

I want it to work inside browser extensions,
and as an interface for AI, reactive programming, and code generation.

But, we are all wowed,
by different things.

WikiWiki is one beautiful marvel,
it is a tiny, perfect, idea, and reinventing it, is nothing by pleasure.

MUDs are an awesome idea, that go way back,
these are the programs behind text adventure games.

It is all fun and games,
until you start building the game, from within the game.

Instead of saying “go north”,
you say create an angry Grue north of here.

And with the help of AI,
MUDs will make you speechless.

And then it will occur to you, you can train AI on them,
you can have AI build them out.

And finally, since it is a text adventure,
you can have an AI generate graphics, and now videos even, for it.

A MUD is collaborative by design,
it is a tiny little program, again a great pleasure to work on.

To mention something a tiny bit more complex,
a Digital Audio Workstation that works in a browser…

Where you already have most of your work done for you,
and you just need the beat sequencer and piano roll.

Can have you reinvent the way music is made,
can have you start a revolution, you are programming music after all.

Once you find your program,
it will become your work of art, and keep your mind sharp for life.

It will cause no discomfort, no frustration,
it will always teach you more, and more.

Often you make strange loops around some subject,
take several months to study something related.

And then resume your work,
no less than 87 times smarter, I am not kidding, at all.

Now with AI, cheap robot dogs, programmable drones, 3D printers,
single board computers, and programmable micro-controllers.

Programming is even more interesting,
it is always getting more interesting.

For example, today there is no excuse,
not to own a robotic dog completely controlled by AI.

The AI runs on a local machine,
you use image recognition to tell the AI what it is looking at.

And finally, you don’t have to chase your dog,
it can deploy a swarm of drones to chase you.
