**SETTING:** *A strip mall recruitment office. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Motivational posters line the walls: "BE ALL YOU CAN BE (AGAIN)" and "THE FEW. THE PROUD. THE AARP-ELIGIBLE." Staff Sergeant DEREK MORRISON, 32, sits behind a metal desk covered in pamphlets. The door creaks open.*

---

**EDNA KOWALSKI**, 88, shuffles in wearing orthopedic shoes, a floral blouse, and clutching a crumpled letter. She peers at the recruiter through thick bifocals.

**EDNA:** Excuse me, young man. I'm looking for the ShopRite. Is this the ShopRite?

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(standing, extending hand)* Ma'am, welcome to the United States Armed Forces Recruitment Center. Staff Sergeant Derek Morrison. Please, have a seat. Can I get you some coffee?

**EDNA:** *(squinting at him)* You're not a butcher.

**SGT. MORRISON:** No ma'am. I'm your dedicated recruitment liaison. And might I say, we've been expecting you. *(gestures to chair)*

**EDNA:** *(sitting slowly, joints audibly popping)* Well, that's very nice, dear, but there's been a mistake. *(waves letter)* I got this in the mail. Says I've been selected for military service. I'm eighty-eight years old. I have bursitis. I take eleven pills every morning and I can't remember what half of them are for.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(nodding seriously)* Mrs. Kowalski, I completely understand your concerns. But let me ask you something: Do you love this country?

**EDNA:** What?

**SGT. MORRISON:** This great nation. The amber waves of grain. Baseball. Apple pie.

**EDNA:** I make a very good pie.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(leaning forward)* I bet you do. And wouldn't you like to protect that pie, Mrs. Kowalski? Protect it from those who would see it... unprotected?

**EDNA:** Young man, the only thing I'm protecting is my parking spot. My husband is in the car and he gets very cranky if I take too long. Now, if you could just point me toward the lunch meats—

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(pulling out a thick folder)* Ma'am, I need you to understand something. This letter is not a mistake. Following extensive analysis by the Department of Defense's Advanced Recruitment Intelligence System—DARIS—you have been identified as an *optimal combat candidate*.

**EDNA:** *(long pause)* ...I'm sorry?

**SGT. MORRISON:** You see, Mrs. Kowalski, modern warfare has changed. We've got exoskeletons that'll have you bench-pressing a refrigerator. Neural implants that download tactical training directly into your cerebral cortex. And the coffee at base? *Outstanding*. We're talking fresh-roasted, single-origin Colombian.

**EDNA:** I do like a good coffee.

**SGT. MORRISON:** DARIS ran the numbers. Turns out, the elderly are *far* superior to young recruits. You've got patience. Wisdom. Seventy years of accumulated problem-solving experience. You've survived the Great Depression's children, the Cold War, eight recessions, and the introduction of self-checkout machines. Meanwhile, we've got nineteen-year-olds who can't read a compass or boil water.

**EDNA:** My grandson can't boil water.

**SGT. MORRISON:** Exactly. *(taps temple)* That's the problem we're solving. The youth are... *(searches for diplomatic word)* ...developmentally aspirational. You, Mrs. Kowalski, are a *proven asset*.

**EDNA:** *(flustered)* This is absurd! I can't serve. I'm a widow!

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(checking folder)* Our records indicate your husband, Walter Kowalski, is very much alive.

**EDNA:** He's dead!

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(raising eyebrow)* Then who's in the Buick LeSabre in the parking lot, ma'am? The one in the handicapped spot with the "Vietnam Veteran" bumper sticker and a man eating a Werther's Original?

**EDNA:** *(long pause)* ...That's... a different Walter.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(reading from folder)* Walter Kowalski. Born March 3rd, 1934. Social Security number ending in 7782. Currently wearing a cardigan and yelling at a pigeon through the windshield.

**EDNA:** *(sighing)* Alright, fine. He's alive. But he's ninety! He can barely walk!

**SGT. MORRISON:** Ma'am, I need to inform you that under the Selective Service Act, as amended under the National Defense Reauthorization Act of 2027, knowingly providing false information to avoid conscription is a federal offense. We're talking up to five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. *(leans back)* Now, I don't want to go down that road. I'm sure *you* don't want to go down that road.

**EDNA:** *(clutches purse)* This is extortion!

**SGT. MORRISON:** It's patriotism, ma'am. There's a difference. *(slides phone across desk)* I'm going to need you to call Walter in.

---

*Edna glares at him. Then, with tremendous reluctance, she pulls out an enormous smartphone with a cracked screen and font size set to "billboard."*

**EDNA:** *(shouting into phone)* WALTER! WALTER, CAN YOU HEAR ME? COME INSIDE! ...NO, NOT THE SHOPRITE! THE NEXT DOOR! ...THE ARMY PLACE! ...NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY! JUST COME!

*She hangs up. They wait. And wait. Through the window, they watch WALTER KOWALSKI, 90, emerge from the Buick at the speed of continental drift. He's wearing a Korean War veteran cap and using a walker with tennis balls on the feet.*

**EDNA:** *(gesturing)* You see this? You see him? He's been walking for two minutes and he hasn't cleared the hood of the car.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(unfazed)* He's pacing himself. Conserving energy. Good tactical instincts.

**EDNA:** He's a hundred and four pounds! A stiff breeze could kill him!

**SGT. MORRISON:** Ma'am, once we get your husband fitted with a Mk. VII Tactical Exoskeleton, that man will be fighting like a silverback gorilla.

*Walter finally pushes through the door, brea thing heavily.*

**WALTER:** *(to Edna)* What the hell is going on? I was listening to Paul Harvey.

**EDNA:** Paul Harvey's been dead for twenty years.

**WALTER:** It was a rerun!

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(standing)* Mr. Kowalski! Staff Sergeant Morrison. Welcome aboard. Please, take a seat. You're actually next on my list.

**WALTER:** *(squinting)* List? What list? Is this about the IRS? I told them, I don't owe nothing.

**SGT. MORRISON:** Sir, you've been selected for military service.

**WALTER:** ...Son, I'm *ninety*.

**SGT. MORRISON:** Yes, sir. And you're about to be the most dangerous ninety-year-old in the Western hemisphere. *(pulls out pamphlet)* Let me walk you through the onboarding process. You'll both undergo MEPS processing—that's Military Entrance Processing—followed by OSUT, One Station Unit Training, though in your case it'll be GERIATRIC PRIME accelerated integration. We're talking neural calibration, exo-fitting, and full combat load familiarization. You'll be Oscar Mike to Fort Bragg by 1800 hours.

**EDNA:** Oscar who?

**SGT. MORRISON:** On the Move, ma'am.

**WALTER:** *(to Edna)* What the hell is he saying?

**EDNA:** I have no idea.

**SGT. MORRISON:** I'm saying you'll both be fully operational warfighters within seventy-two hours.

**WALTER:** *(slamming walker)* Now hold on just a minute! We didn't sign up for this! We're old! We're tired! We just want to buy ham and go home!

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(pauses, then speaks quietly)* Mr. and Mrs. Kowalski. May I be direct with you?

**EDNA:** You haven't been already?

**SGT. MORRISON:** This war we're preparing for? You helped build it.

*Silence.*

**SGT. MORRISON:** Every election. Every vote. For decades. Your generation elected the leaders, backed the policies, cheered the spending, waved the flags. And now? *(gestures vaguely)* Here we are.

**WALTER:** We were protecting our values!

**SGT. MORRISON:** Sir, DARIS analyzed sixty years of voting data. You weren't protecting values. You were— *(reads from tablet)* —and I'm quoting the AI here— "pissing a circle around your social status."

**EDNA:** *(gasping)* Well I never—

**SGT. MORRISON:** The system determined that no young American should die in a war they didn't create. This is *your* war. You voted for it. Not out of wisdom—out of pride, out of habit, out of tribal loyalty. And now, with the technology to make it possible... you're going to finish it.

*Long pause. Walter and Edna exchange a look.*

**WALTER:** *(quietly)* We don't want to die.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(smiling)* Mr. Kowalski. Nobody dies in war anymore.

**EDNA:** ...What?

**SGT. MORRISON:** DARPA Project LAZARUS. Full consciousness backup, synthetic tissue regeneration, and emergency neural restoration. You get blown up on Monday, you're back on your feet by Thursday. Might even come back *younger*. We had a ninety-three-year-old come back as a spry eighty-one after a direct artillery hit. Said he hadn't felt that good since Nixon.

**WALTER:** *(bewildered)* This is insane.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(standing, straightening uniform)* Sir. Ma'am. You've lived long lives. Good lives. Now your country is asking you to serve—not to die, but to *finally* take responsibility. *(extends hand)* What do you say?

*The Kowalskis look at each other. Edna clutches Walter's arm. A long moment passes.*

**EDNA:** *(sighing heavily)* ...Sir, yes sir.

**WALTER:** *(defeated)* Sir... yes sir.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(grinning, pressing intercom)* Corporal Brown, we've got two for transport. Have someone secure the Buick in Lot C. Mr. and Mrs. Kowalski are heading to fitting.

**CORPORAL BROWN:** *(over intercom)* Copy that, Sergeant. The 14:00 transport to Fort Bragg has room.

*A young soldier enters, snapping a salute.*

**SOLDIER:** Sir! I'll take care of their vehicle. *(to Edna)* Ma'am, do you have the keys?

**EDNA:** *(handing them over, dazed)* There's a coupon book in the glove compartment. For the ShopRite.

**SOLDIER:** I'll see that it's secured, ma'am.

*The soldier exits. Sergeant Morrison gestures toward a back door.*

**SGT. MORRISON:** Right this way. Transport's waiting. *(picks up Walter's walker)* You won't be needing this much longer, sir.

**WALTER:** *(shuffling forward)* I served in Korea, you know.

**SGT. MORRISON:** I know, sir. And your country thanks you for your continued service.

*As they exit, Edna turns back one last time.*
