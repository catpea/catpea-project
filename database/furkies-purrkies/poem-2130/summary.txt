Operation: Golden Years
Monday • December 29th 2025 • 4:38:28 pm

**SETTING:** *A strip mall recruitment office. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Motivational posters line the walls: "BE ALL YOU CAN BE (AGAIN)" and "THE FEW. THE PROUD. THE AARP-ELIGIBLE." Staff Sergeant DEREK MORRISON, 32, sits behind a metal desk covered in pamphlets. The door creaks open.*

---

**EDNA KOWALSKI**, 88, shuffles in wearing orthopedic shoes, a floral blouse, and clutching a crumpled letter. She peers at the recruiter through thick bifocals.

**EDNA:** Excuse me, young man. I'm looking for the ShopRite. Is this the ShopRite?

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(standing, extending hand)* Ma'am, welcome to the United States Armed Forces Recruitment Center. Staff Sergeant Derek Morrison. Please, have a seat. Can I get you some coffee?

**EDNA:** *(squinting at him)* You're not a butcher.

**SGT. MORRISON:** No ma'am. I'm your dedicated recruitment liaison. And might I say, we've been expecting you. *(gestures to chair)*

**EDNA:** *(sitting slowly, joints audibly popping)* Well, that's very nice, dear, but there's been a mistake. *(waves letter)* I got this in the mail. Says I've been selected for military service. I'm eighty-eight years old. I have bursitis. I take eleven pills every morning and I can't remember what half of them are for.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(nodding seriously)* Mrs. Kowalski, I completely understand your concerns. But let me ask you something: Do you love this country?

**EDNA:** What?

**SGT. MORRISON:** This great nation. The amber waves of grain. Baseball. Apple pie.

**EDNA:** I make a very good pie.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(leaning forward)* I bet you do. And wouldn't you like to protect that pie, Mrs. Kowalski? Protect it from those who would see it... unprotected?

**EDNA:** Young man, the only thing I'm protecting is my parking spot. My husband is in the car and he gets very cranky if I take too long. Now, if you could just point me toward the lunch meats—

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(pulling out a thick folder)* Ma'am, I need you to understand something. This letter is not a mistake. Following extensive analysis by the Department of Defense's Advanced Recruitment Intelligence System—DARIS—you have been identified as an *optimal combat candidate*.

**EDNA:** *(long pause)* ...I'm sorry?

**SGT. MORRISON:** You see, Mrs. Kow...

...er—

**SGT. MORRISON:** The system determined that no young American should die in a war they didn't create. This is *your* war. You voted for it. Not out of wisdom—out of pride, out of habit, out of tribal loyalty. And now, with the technology to make it possible... you're going to finish it.

*Long pause. Walter and Edna exchange a look.*

**WALTER:** *(quietly)* We don't want to die.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(smiling)* Mr. Kowalski. Nobody dies in war anymore.

**EDNA:** ...What?

**SGT. MORRISON:** DARPA Project LAZARUS. Full consciousness backup, synthetic tissue regeneration, and emergency neural restoration. You get blown up on Monday, you're back on your feet by Thursday. Might even come back *younger*. We had a ninety-three-year-old come back as a spry eighty-one after a direct artillery hit. Said he hadn't felt that good since Nixon.

**WALTER:** *(bewildered)* This is insane.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(standing, straightening uniform)* Sir. Ma'am. You've lived long lives. Good lives. Now your country is asking you to serve—not to die, but to *finally* take responsibility. *(extends hand)* What do you say?

*The Kowalskis look at each other. Edna clutches Walter's arm. A long moment passes.*

**EDNA:** *(sighing heavily)* ...Sir, yes sir.

**WALTER:** *(defeated)* Sir... yes sir.

**SGT. MORRISON:** *(grinning, pressing intercom)* Corporal Brown, we've got two for transport. Have someone secure the Buick in Lot C. Mr. and Mrs. Kowalski are heading to fitting.

**CORPORAL BROWN:** *(over intercom)* Copy that, Sergeant. The 14:00 transport to Fort Bragg has room.

*A young soldier enters, snapping a salute.*

**SOLDIER:** Sir! I'll take care of their vehicle. *(to Edna)* Ma'am, do you have the keys?

**EDNA:** *(handing them over, dazed)* There's a coupon book in the glove compartment. For the ShopRite.

**SOLDIER:** I'll see that it's secured, ma'am.

*The soldier exits. Sergeant Morrison gestures toward a back door.*

**SGT. MORRISON:** Right this way. Transport's waiting. *(picks up Walter's walker)* You won't be needing this much longer, sir.

**WALTER:** *(shuffling forward)* I served in Korea, you know.

**SGT. MORRISON:** I know, sir. And your country thanks you for your continued service.

*As they exit, Edna turns back one last time.*
