No matter what we are told,
we don’t __really__ get __that__ old.

We just need to move a lot more,
and listen to books as not to be a total bore.

Preferably while hiking or camping,
and it should be a book that is inspiring or striking.

We simply need to walk and stop taking the bus,
because the fountain of youth is within us.

The really real truth,
is that we retain out youth.

You see evidence of that in the squirt,
of discovering a fat furry spider on your shirt.

Or when you face __that __angry goose,
that everyone said was on the loose.

Or when a bat just does not care,
and freaking get entangled in you hair.

Or when you find a snake in the grass,
and it just happens to have extra sss...sass.

Or hear a bear roar,
right outside you tent’s door.

You see, it is at that stage,
that you get a glimpse of your true age.

And to figure out your exact number,
you will need to uncoil yourself from your slumber.

So go buy a big backpack and a nifty tent,
and know, book and adventure, is time well spent.
