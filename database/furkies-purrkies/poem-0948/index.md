A world school is a must,
because the world and its people deserve the best future.

But it has to be done right, corruption has to be prevented,
right in the beginning , we just need to find a way...

That students can use,
to go around tainted lectures.

So a voting mechanism,
where the graduates have most to say.

They won't manipulate as hard,
because un-education..

Would destroy their future just as well,
and no achiever will want that.

---

Un-education, memorization, debt,
no real results, are an indication of a scam.

The real scams, produce no evidence,
and sometimes people don't quite see them,selves as bad.

A lot of teachers just don't know,
what is going on, what teaching is.

But they do know,
that they are doing something wrong.

Because, when they identify what they call a gifted person,
they will push them right through.

They will protect them,
from toxic education.

This may sound nice,
and certainly helps a lot of people.

But at the same time, they will terrorize,
those who don't know to learn on their own.

The so called gifted person,
is just a self educated person.

The ones under the threat of being held back,
don't have functioning homes.

Or their homes do not have the culture,
of aiming to become wise and great being.

Being held back, is prison,
you are forever branded as late.

The classmates that were family,
will now see a filthy pig.

That is the picture,
that teachers and bullies create.

---

All our problems, are a result of ineffective,
or downright fake schools.

---  

We need to be able to place the world school,
in the hands of people moving away from danger zones.

It has to be an inexpensive device,
at first a music player with narrated books.

Which helps with stress,
and sleep.

And above all with removing them,
from whatever indoctrination they received.

This is a rechargeable device,
in the shape of a red heart.

People can grab them by a fist full,
at any border passing.

Narrated by the trustworthy young people,
first in their own language.

But translations in the worlds most popular language,
will also be available.

These books will be read and re-read,
hundred of times.

Listening to the popular language version,
wil help with learning it.

In the future, the language barriers,
can only make things worse.

This is the century,
where the world comes together.

---

Enabled by the broadening of culture,
that access to powerful books allow for.

Students will be able to move on to the next step,
the world school.

A school that does not have grades,
but rather game-like mechanics.

Where it is far more difficult,
to move several levels forward.

Then simply to,
grasp the subjects.

---

It is a self paced, self directed program,
with the reward of remote work.

Here, in a private and dignified way,
companies will be able to track student progress.

And place offers, a measure of student anonymity,
will secure their name, if they reject the offers. 

It is a school, a way to get a job,
and above all else...

A place where a person can build,
a series of startups, until one works our fo them.

---

Let me close with the following words,
what would take one peron a billion years to implement.

Will only take one year,
if one billion people help to build it.

The school will build it self inside out,
the way the world encyclopedia did.
