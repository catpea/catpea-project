The Road Towards Greatness
Thursday • June 8th 2023 • 11:04:18 pm

Growing up,
is all about wisdom,

It is about,
unlocking ourselves.

...about,
finding our place in the universe.

---

And while growing older,
is automatic.

Growing up,
requires effort.

Though it isn’t hard,
and it is always worth it.

---

The levels we traverse.
Are basically cultures.

At first,
they are simple.

And as we grow,
our culture becomes more advanced.

---

It is a terrible idea,
to just grow up part way.

As the worst of the higher culture,
will gain an unfair advantage.

They may appear smarter,
but it is just their higher culture.

---

And it is a tragedy,
to leave people behind.

For example by tolerating,
ineffective education.

By thinking that world poverty is reality,
and not about control and power.

---

Humanity her self also grows,
though only in proportion to our heights.

Whatever progress is to be made,
it requires real education.

Real education brings knowledge,
and knowledge ignites into wisdom.

---

It is only in light wisdom,
on the shoulders of giants.

That we can understand,
our road ahead, and meaning.

And the road is the same for us all,
a life long rise towards greatness.
