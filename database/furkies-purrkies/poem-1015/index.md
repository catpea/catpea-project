It is fake enough, because it is ineffective, and a lot of teachers don’t know this,
many don’t care, others are driving the fraud, but many teachers don’t know it is fake.

There is a way,
that you can get to the bottom of fake education.

You have to think by subtle analogy, to incompetent corporations,
crime family based governments, and other broken things.

---

Ineffective education is one that has little or no effect,
that does not compare to self-education to a thousand or a hundred books.

It means our parents going to school,
and learning that it is not for them.

And never fully realizing, that the teachers were just pretending to teach,
that the lessons never came together, because that want a real education.

That was the A+ students, who memorized everything,
and decided it was fair game to betray the younger generation as well.

To sell them out,
for paychecks, praise.

---

Your generations is facing, un-education, layered indoctrination, __Confabulation__,
if not downright glossolalia, especially where experts are concerned.

But this is your world, and you, along with your generation,
are its caretakers, and as these things go – its only hope for the future.

---

It is not enough to hang on to earth, with muscle or glue,
it is not enough, to just join, be it a club or protest.

There are no institutions, organizations, or governments capable,
of performing the required changes.

The changes are both at once elimination of poverty and ineffective schooling,
and that it hard to do, all in one go.

As we neither have the culture, class, nor education,
to once and for all put an end to misery.

What it will take, is a generation,
and what it will require to sustain, is an endless multi-generational effort.

---

We have done well with teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic,
and helping ourselves to rise higher.

But we need far more beyond that, and none of it can be gibberish,
gibberish, cult and indoctrination, can only unravel the future.

---

Only the culture of love of wisdom, culture of intellectuals,
of children raised to understand that we must each grow all the way up...

Can set things right, can fix schools, help cultures accelerate forward,
and end the threats of poverty, hunger, homelessness, crime, and war.

---

Only a global cultural shift for the better,
can change the world for the better.

---

The first step there, is to stop waiting to be taught,
and stop waiting for all the disconnected facts you’ve been spoon fed.

By uneducated and incompetent teachers and pretenders,
to somehow all come together, and form a coherent education.

They won’t, the schools are make-believe,
the only education there is, is self education.

---

The solution to he threats teachers make,
is not good grades, but you becoming an intellectual and entrepreneur.

By studying art, design, computers and programming, wisdom, greatness,
anything that leads you away from ineffective education.

---

Only education, that brings you knowledge, wisdom,
and eventually greatness, can help you grow.

Desperately trying to pay off med school,
while barely staying awake, or on the road, or being there for those who care.

Is still not the right way, you owe it to your elder self,
to carefully, gently, beautifully, learn for real, and continue to grow in greatness.

---

Ineffective school can only lead to the world that you see around you now,
and self education is the first step in building real Higher Education schools.

Self directed and self paced, where the graduation is real, marked,
by launching a startup and reaching financial independence.
