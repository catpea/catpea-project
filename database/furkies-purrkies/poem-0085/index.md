Today was my day of rest,

and then I went jogging to run another test.

I got really tired after my run,

but I said "Not until I write my poem, will I be done."

---

Earlier I wrote a little programs to [make art](https://github.com/fantasyui-com/mockup)

overall it was a really good start.

I woke up at six in the morning,

and jumped out of bed without a warning.

Now the hour nears eleven,

getting into my bed will feel like heaven.

I am not sure how I feel about staying up late to write my rhyme,

but there is something sweet about writing just before bed time.
