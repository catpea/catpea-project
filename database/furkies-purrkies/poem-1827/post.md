Well, as the case always is the good idea of internet,
has ended up getting some low intelligence parasites.

That under the guise of being helpful,
have been working to gag the internet with advertising.

This is a terrible idea in the age of AI,
that can run at home, automating software tasks.

And I think the end result will be,
new powerful applications based on browsers.

---

They are going to be Integrated Development Environments,
or as I like to call them Data Laboratories.

That will move from hiding ads,
to extracting data from many sources.

And presenting them under one,
customizable and consistent UI.

It is a strange thing,
because it is a response to a betrayal of the browsers.

Of injecting too much, of nobody needs,
[librewolf][1] is where we are currently at.

A browser that removes unnecessary junk,
questionable features, and just serves web pages.

But we are already making a step beyond that,
and here [FreeTube][2] is an example.

It is a customized web browser, that only browsers one website,
and heavily modifies the user interface.

But a third level is coming,
like FreeTube programs based on a browser.

But only focused on visual programming,
and what people are programming at home is their own business.

Armed with artificial intelligence,
integrated development environments are unstoppable.

Some will be visual programming environments even,
where with help of AI young people can create their own apps.

---

Finally, data extraction in the age of private AI like [ollama][3] enables,
is too simple, and a matter of askign the AI to do the scrape.

And even remove, suspicious entries or comments,
prior to returning the feed.

---

I am not at all surprised that small minded business men,
didnâ€™t see this coming.

But even I thought that they wouldn't disable ad blokers,
surely they must have known their used had the high round.

---

All of this means, that it is time to build AI programs,
that help to launch competent startups.

And that it is the young people, and not the out of touch,
tone deaf parasites, that should direct the future.

All hail the soon to come new class of Chief Executive Officers,
the AI enabled teenagers and their automated companies.

Now,
the future is in competent hands.
