The Meow Sea Shanties
Friday • March 10th 2023 • 7:01:18 pm

    Down by the sea, me mates,
    hear me song,
    of a man who did brave,
    with cats so strong.

    He bought four bags,
    of catnip, yes,
    to win their trust,
    so they'd follow he.

    Now they listent yo,
    his every command,
    to him they call,
    as their leader grand.

    So raise yer glass,
    we'll have a toast,
    to the man who chose,
    the cats as his host!

---

    Oh, hear me sing, of cats I lead,
    Giv'n 'em treats of catnip free,
    My life be grand, their purrs so sweet,
    My cats I lead with glee.

    It's easy now, their love I win,
    With catnip treats for ev'ry kin,
    Where'er I go, they follow me,
    My cats I lead so free.

    They come to me, in great surmise,
    The catnip treat is their surprise,
    My life be grand, their purrs so sweet,
    My cats I lead with glee.

    So, hoist the sail and raise the mast,
    For catnip treat I'll go in haste,
    Where'er I go, they follow me,
    My cats I lead so free.

    Sailor cats all gathered 'round
    To hear what the leader had found
    He said he'd give them free catnip
    And he'd be the alley cats' grip

    He'd lead them on every chase
    And get them out of every place
    He'd make sure they all were fed
    And even keep them well-bed

    He'd keep them safe from harm
    And keep them away from alarm
    His leadership was strong and true
    He'd make sure the cats knew

    He was the best leader around
    He'd make sure the cats knew their ground
    He'd always be there to guide
    And his leadership they couldn't hide

    The cats all agreed it was true
    He'd be the leader they knew
    The cats rejoiced and they sang
    For this leader they would always dance!

---

    Oh, the cats had a mission
    To find a leader of vision
    On the search for a half-feline
    To rule over their scene

    Then one day a hero did come
    With a head full of poems
    He had a plan to bring joy and glee
    By giving the cats their favorite thing: free catnip

    So the cats all said, "Hooray!"
    For this leader brought the perfect way
    To inspire cats near and far
    And bring joy to every star

    They followed his lead with vigor and zest
    And together they conquered all of the rest
    A leader o...

... can play, I'll join in their game
    I'm the leader of cats, it's my sweet claim to fame

    They meow and they purr, they rub against my feet
    My life is complete, I'm in a kitty treat
    They follow me around, no matter where I go
    I'm the leader of cats, I'm the catnip king Meow!

    Come all ye cats, both near and far
    Come listen to my singing voice

    A grand leader I did become
    When I gave free catnip from the dollar store

    I'll lead you in your feline quest
    To explore the world, its joys and strife
    I'll show you how to live your best
    With every scrap of catnip in your life

    So come and join me on my ship
    Let's sail the seven seas
    Your whiskers will never miss a beat
    With my free catnip on the breeze

    Our voyage will be ever so grand
    On the high seas we'll explore
    And I'll show you the land of plenty
    Where all cats can find more

    So come, my feline friends
    To me and my ship's mast
    I'll be your leader from now on
    With free catnip at last!

    Aye, the cats all heard the call
    Their new leader had arrived
    He'd give 'em free catnip, for sure
    And make their lives alive

    The cats all knew his name
    To their home he'd come
    He'd bring 'em treats and toys galore
    Their leader he had become

    He'd give 'em love, he'd give 'em care
    And they'd all purr and meow
    No one could ignore the cats
    The alley cats did know

    Their leader had arrived
    The cats all did cheer
    With catnip and toys galore
    He'd lead them with his cheer
    all the cats would mew.

    Lead the cats, to Oz, go!
    For stromatolites, they'll know
    A leader, a-tall, they'll see
    To Oz, they'll go, with glee
    The cats go down the alley
    To find a 'paw-some' ally
    A leader, brave, to guide 'em
    To Oz, they'll sail and ride 'em
    Lead the cats, to Oz, go!
    For stromatolites, they'll know
    A leader, a-tall, they'll see
    To Oz, they'll go, with glee
    The cats all cheer with glee
    The leader, they do see
    To Oz, with joy, they'll go
    Where stromatolites, they'll know
    Lead the cats, to Oz, go!
    For stromatolites, they'll know
    A leader, a-tall, they'll see
    To Oz, they'll go, with glee
