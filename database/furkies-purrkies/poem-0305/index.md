That is all you get to save the world with,

if it was easy somebody else would have done it already.

Next time you're in class, look at the back row,

one of them is a genius who does not believe in the world anymore, the rest need help, the sooner the better.

I know you can prevent them from fracturing,

I know you have it in you to save the world.

All around the world, liars stretch accepted patterns they hardly understand, like a bubble gum, and with perfect deniability,

there is no blame, there is no proof, there are no laws that could help here, nothing can be done to fix anything.

But also nothing that Humanity needs,

has been lost permanently.

The state of things as we see today,

can be prevented from re-occurring come next-generation by means of real education, and prevention of emergence of desperate creatures that become perfect liars.

The same goes for criminals,

the idea of stealing an ATM to become free comes from little more than Saturday morning cartoons and desperation.

With real politics and wise politicians, we will see Universal Basic Income come into reality,

and nobody is going to rob anything if they already have the money and live a life of Knowledge, Authenticity, and Dignity.

---

As unbelievable as it sounds, Prevention coupled with Real Education,

that guides people towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness, is where Humanity will find its future.

Once liars take to power, we can only wait for them to retire,

and while we are waiting we have to help children grow so that they will become the Great Beings that will may their place.
