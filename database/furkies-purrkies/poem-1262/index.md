It is not how you do it,
it is where you take it, and when you stop.

---

Your path of creation is just that,
a journey with a beginning and an open end.

Commonly the first step is doodles,
then we move to pencils, and later brushes.

There are different ways to use tools,
and few artists, use them in their own way.

One common way to use art pencils,
Is to use a blending stump, to smudge pencil lines.

This gives even a simple sketch,
a startling level of realism.

Some artist don’t use brushes,
instead they paint on large canvas with a painting-knife.

They embrace imperfection,
and celebrate paint and texture.

In fact the impasto technique,
does not take away detail but multiplies it, immensely.

First you view the subject on a large canvas,
in all its details…

Then upon a closer look you discover,
the heart of the art.

Texture, hue, tone, motion, touch,
dedication, wisdom.

---

Most often artists advance in their journey,
step by step, refining their techniques.

---

I spoke of the brushes first,
to make you angry second.

Because, real artists use projectors,
in the beginning, their hand is guided.

After a few portraits,
they memorize all the unique flows and shadows.

And within days, not weeks,
they begin synthesizing faces that haven't existed before.

And once they have a solid base,
and proper experience after a month or two…

They gain the ability to see what other artists do,
to make their portraits special.

To make the eyes come to life.
to make the portrait breathe.

---

Get angry,
because the ability to create Art was stolen from you.

Fake education,
arrogant teachers.

You were an artist all along,
and it was taken from you.

Let me make this clear,
you are wrong;

When you say;
that you can’t even draw a stick figure.

[Camera Obscura][1] is tradition,
and the legacy of the masters.

You are an artist,
you were an artist all along.

---

This is where the question of,
“Where you take your art” - comes in.

Will you paint people, comedy,
or content of character?

Will you dare to create works of sorrow,
or will you let your paintings add laughter in between the lines of your legacy.

Where will you set your limits,
huge eyes and exaggerated cuteness, or some new kind of hyper realism.

---

The definition of good art,
is not; something that you have to see first.

To put it simply,
good art, changes lives.

But as with all things, how far are you willing to go,
to have your art speak for you?

---

So you see, there is no question,
that you were an artist all along.

Our first step into art,
cannot be easier, and it is realism, full on humanity.

Now imagine, how powerful Good or Great Art can be,
if the first step alone, is heart and soul.
