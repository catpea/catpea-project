ONN Evening News - An Old News Network Presentation
Friday • December 12th 2025 • 8:37:51 pm

**ANCHOR 1:**
Good evening. Across Christendom tonight, fear, rumor, and revelation dominate the headlines. Authorities warn that unseen enemies may be closer than anyone imagines.

**ANCHOR 2:**
We have a lot to cover. Let's get started.

---

### The Fall of the Templars

**ANCHOR 1:**
Royal officials are announcing sweeping arrests of the Knights Templar. The ancient military order stands accused of idol worship, secret initiation rituals, and allegiance to a demon known only as *Baphomet*. Confessions—some extracted under interrogation—describe spitting on the cross and secret rites held far from public view.

**ANCHOR 2:**
When institutions gain wealth and independence, suspicion follows. These accusations reflect not just fear of heresy, but fear of power operating outside royal control. The Templars have become bankers to kings—and that makes them dangerous.

---

### Plague and Poison

**ANCHOR 1:**
As plague spreads through cities and villages, reports surge of powdered toxins thrown into wells. Foreigners, travelers, and minorities are being detained for questioning.

**ANCHOR 2:**
People need someone to blame. Random catastrophe is harder to accept than deliberate evil. Someone *has* to be responsible—and outsiders make convenient targets.

---

### The Secret Networks

**ANCHOR 1:**
Jewish communities are once again accused of operating secret communication networks, allegedly coordinating attacks against Christian towns. Authorities insist investigations are ongoing.

**ANCHOR 2:**
This is a classic pattern: an insular group becomes imagined as unified, omniscient, and dangerous. Communities that maintain their own traditions get recast as sinister cabals.

---

### The Satanic Threat

**ANCHOR 1:**
Church officials warn of a vast Satanic organization. Witches, they say, meet nightly in forests for sabbats involving infant sacrifice, demonic intercourse, and plots against Christian rulers.

**ANCHOR 2:**
The key fear isn't individual witches—it's the belief in a *network*. A hidden enemy coordinating across borders. That's what terrifies people most.

### Venetian Shadows

**ANCHOR 1:**
Venice denies allegations that its Council of Ten operates a continent-wide spy and assassination network. Critics allege merc...

...bridge face accusations of necromancy. Scholars allegedly summon demons in exchange for forbidden knowledge.

**ANCHOR 2:**
Universities are information hubs doing work most people can't understand. Anything misunderstood becomes suspect. Latin texts and arcane experiments look a lot like magic to outsiders.

---

### Soul Stealers

**ANCHOR 1:**
Anatomists stand accused of stealing souls during dissections. Protesters demand bans on corpse study, calling it an offense against God and nature.

**ANCHOR 2:**
Dissection shatters old beliefs about the body—and that is terrifying. If scholars can cut open the dead, what else might they do?

---

### The Banker Conspiracy

**ANCHOR 1:**
Lombard bankers are accused of orchestrating debt traps to enslave entire kingdoms and manipulate rulers through financial leverage.

**ANCHOR 2:**
Finance is invisible. You can't see debt the way you can see an army. People sense they're being controlled but can't see how—and that breeds suspicion.

---

### Hidden Prophecies

**ANCHOR 1:**
Dante's writings are rumored to contain coded prophecies predicting political collapse and the fall of the Church.

**ANCHOR 2:**
People assume complex texts must hide secrets meant only for the initiated. Dense literature becomes a mirror for whatever fears you bring to it.

---

### Masters of Time

**ANCHOR 1:**
Clockmakers are accused of manipulating time itself. Villagers report bells ringing at impossible hours, suggesting dark forces at work.

**ANCHOR 2:**
New technology feels magical until it becomes familiar. Clocks mechanize something that has always belonged to nature and God. That unsettles people.

---

### Heresy in Stone

**ANCHOR 1:**
Cathedrals are under investigation for hidden heretical symbols allegedly embedded by stonemasons in their carvings and designs.

**ANCHOR 2:**
Monumental art invites overreading. When buildings take generations to complete, people forget the original intent—and start seeing messages everywhere.

---

### Closing

**ANCHOR 1:**
From courts to villages, from universities to churches, one truth remains: danger is believed to be hidden, organized, and everywhere.

**ANCHOR 2:**
Authorities urge faith. Investigations continue.

**ANCHOR 1:**
Good night—and stay vigilant.
