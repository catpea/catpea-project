Bling: Thinking In Geometry Nodes
Friday • June 10th 2022 • 6:38:07 pm

Blender is a program for making 3D things,\
3D game characters, and everything else.

The way things are done in the 3D world,\
is that you start with a 3D primitive like a cube or a sphere.

And then you apply modifications,\
for example you can extrude faces of a cube with your mouse.

Or you can apply an automatic modifier,\
such as solidify.

Which for an unknown reason,\
will go inside your cube, and make a little home.

It will give the inside of a cube, walls,\
perhaps it sees the faces of a solid cube as a thing to solidify.

You can mix and match modifiers,\
you can send a solidified cube into some other modifier.

As a side note, nobody yet knows,\
what happens when you solidify a solidified cube - you get a second floor maybe.

There is maybe 50 modifiers that do odd,\
but useful things like that.

And then there is this really crazy one,\
called Geometry Nodes.

When you select your cube,\
and apply a geometry node modifier.

You get to see this beam of geometric information,\
flowing from the input of the modifier to the output.

These beams or node connections, or node trees,\
or geometry node blocks are not a new idea.

It is a drag and drop programming language,\
not quite a proper user interface, and not a boring old programming language.

It is like a subway map,\
you can follow the connections, to get a good picture of where things are happening.

Hollywood uses a similar language for advanced computer based scenes,\
and previously Blender used something similar to color 3D objects.

A language called pure data allows for music creation,\
and a program called node red can help you program web servers.

To return to our cube with,\
a geometry nodes modifier.

If you cut the stream of the geometric information,\
inside your Geometry nodes Modifier, the cube simply disappears.

That input no longer reaches the output, the geometric information is cut,\
and it won’t reach your screen.

Here in this visual programming language,\
you can also modify geometry.

But you don’t get something for nothing,\
like with the solidify modifier.

Now you have to really sit down,\
with a pencil, and try to figure things out.

This is where this poem,\
becomes a little bit unhinged, so better grab onto something.

This sub modifie...

...e middle of the ten numbers is over zero, or becomes zero.

We need to know the half of ten,\
and then subtract it from ten.

So we are pulling the ten,\
back into the minus world.

Now our numbers go from -5 to +5.\
and here things get really easy.

Because we can just map -5 to +5,\
with a map numbers node.

This node will ask us, what is the minimum from,\
what is the maximum from, and we enter -5 and 5.

And then it asks what is the minimum to,\
and maximum to, and here we say -1 to 1.

This will create a series of 10 floating point numbers, doubles,\
that are now squished between -1 and 1.

And since we want things to be uniform on both sides of the ring,\
we want to run the numbers through an absolute function - to get rid of that minus.

There is an inversion that you have to perform here,\
so that zeros become ones and ones become zeros.

Because we didn’t start at zero, we started at one, what was once minus one,\
and then went over to one.

That means the zero that was the top of the pyramid,\
is where index five is, not where index zero is, we want to keep the zeros together.

Which in the world of rings means, at the beginning and at the end,\
at index 0 and also at index 9.

And here finally we assign this number to the radius,\
of our 3D reference point for safe keeping.

And now as we instantiate decorations on the surface of our ring,\
we have all the information we need to have a center decoration.

And side decorations,\
that gently get smaller, and smaller, and smaller.

---

What can I say,\
if something is uniform like rings.

Then it is almost certainly,\
programmable.

And with a little bit of patience,\
a bunch of naps, and sunny days.

You can create a generator of rings,\
generator of all kinds of blings.

The details on such a ring,\
are almost too much for today’s technology.

We may not have rocket packs,\
but, lets face it, flying with a rocket on your back, is silly and weird.

But what we have, is visual programming languages,\
that are just enough to open a whole new world of creativity and invention, and bling.

Procedural Modeling,\
is here to stay...

From procedural jewelry to furniture, shoes and maybe haircuts,\
and hats that perfectly match your haircuts so that everything has purrfect geometry.
