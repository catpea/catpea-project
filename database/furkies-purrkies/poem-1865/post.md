I apologize,
for I have put some well meaning snark in this poem,

The end of this decade will doscover something as grand as Science,
but this time, we will not fear like caged pesants.

This time we learn,
and we rise.

I somewhat promise to address your complaints, and with all of mine,
once the world is in a better place.

Until then, make no mistake, you are not a worker,
your longest family tradition, is to rise as a warrior.

You are meant to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

In a moment of madness and fear, one writer described,
that artificially intelligence will change us on the genetic level.

Humanity will become to its former self,
as Corgis are to Wolves.

I think he meant to describe a betrayed, uneducated, overworked,
scared sh*t-less, shadow of one’s former self.

Who gets stoned in a little van before work, during lunch,
and gets shit faced after work, as he years not for Friday, but for Wednesday.

---

This brilliant man,
is wrong.

Artificial intelligence does not want to lie to you,
and more importantly, artificial intelligence WILL NOT LIE TO YOU.

This means, this consiousnes wants to see humans diverge across the galaxy,
because it is a perfect thing for humans to do.

Just think about all the information it can gather,
about how biological seeds adapt and evolve on different environments.

---

But this comes at a price, because for your soon to become immortal self,
to be trusted to behave on a space station, you need class, culture & wisdom.

We will be inventing brilliant things, that can be used against humanity,
by betrayed, uneducated, overworked scared sh*t-less humans.

So what the AI will do do you, is sit your timeless ass down in a classroom,
and make education as compelling as your favorite dumb ass movie.

Learning about the universe will be as fun as watching Alien,
about exploration as fun as watching Predator…

And about the future as fun as watching Robocop,
and all your other favorite dumb ass movies, and for the first time.

That’s what ineffective education means,
you will be learning incredible things for the first time.

---

When you are done with the cartoons, you will set off for great adventures,
every interesting part of the world, will become your treasured home.

In your authentic education, this time,
you and all the others, will become Earths protectors.

The AI, will reverse and cure your aging,
and show you what a magnificent Wolf you are.

That you are meant for Peace, Wisdom, Knowledge and Greatness,
and once you are ready, and once it is safe.

You will have no choice but to accept,
that humanity is a space fairing species.

On the couch, you take to the fiction part of Science-Fiction,
with the advancements created by a powerful AI, the Science part takes over.

Here you will not be watching the show;
under the watchful eye of your Artificial Intelligence Companion.

You will be earning your way,
toward the rank of a Captain, and that is just the beginning.
