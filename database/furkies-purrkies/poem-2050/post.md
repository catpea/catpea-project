"Diagrams, divide and conquer,
modules emerge."

---

Any one piece of your program can be reliably created in one afternoon,
all that AI asks for, is that your request is well thought out and coherent.

You should encourage AI to create lightweight and readable code,
with comments that are easy to understand by non-professionals.

When asking for the project README file,
state that you want copy and paste friendly examples.

---

This will make sure that the AI does not get confused,
comments are beautiful, and README is educational.

---

You will need an idea that moves you,
something that calls to you.

---

It can be a web browser game based on pixel art,
where character animation requirements are minimal.

Where AI can generate backgrounds, monsters,
and same monster variations.

You can make it into an infinite self building world,
or an operating system desktop with critters.

AI will help you with automatic expansion,
character dialogues and state machine based in-word devices.

---

It can be a code editor that runs in a browser add-on,
or developer tools, that is easily installed in a web page via WebComponets.

You can create variations such as a split screen code bin,
with editor on the left and HTML preview on the right.

---

A customized web browser with a built in firewall,
where websites ask for permission to make connections.

A visual programming language that builds Web Browser Extension,
or deploys to self provisioning servers that handle infinite work loads.

You just put a job on a central or distributed queue,
and have workers bid or snag it, solve it, and put the result back on the queue.

---

Once you begin programming your idea, reusable modules will naturally form,
aiding in code readability, system architecture, and your mental model of it.

Each one is a small afternoon universe, almost a product on its own,
and an education so precious that no school will ever match it.

It is highly likely that you will be drawn to creating programming tools,
as they will help you as well.

Now with powerful AI everywhere, your code will always be strong,
and your vision will assemble it a module at a time, daily.

---

If at any point you or AI gets confused from tiredness, or guessing,
simply ask the AI to re-flow your code, or rewrite from scrach.

If you get in big trouble, simply ask it it to create a requirements document,
that is based on your work thus far, edit the document to fix confusion.

And start a new chat or project,
based on a nice clean and fresh set of requirements.

---

Jumping into JavaScript asking AI funny questions,
complaining about weird syntax.

Describing odd computer game ideas,
listening to AI offering new tangents.

The results are instant with programs like [Electron Fiddle][1],
you just paste the code around.

You will make a program on your first day, you can even ask AI,
to modularize it, to see what modules are.

---

Go find a powerful AI, and ask it to build a game,
that teaches you [web technologies][2].
