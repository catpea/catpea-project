From Fluff To Buff, A Real Doctor's Advice
Tuesday • January 3rd 2023 • 9:15:14 pm

This here is a real Doctor’s advice,
for humans, cats, squirrels and cute mice.

Cute furry creatures with all their their fluff,
can very easily get really buff.

So as long as you like peanuts and protein,
you are in.

---

First of all have a tiny per-workout meal,
this is a very big deal.

A singe peanut will do,
but you should have a few.

---

If you are not alone,
remind your furry fren. to put away their phone.

And then just grab them by their little hands,
and help them swiftly dance.

Maybe even find a neat song,
to which you can both dance along.

Squirrels especially, are natures athletes,
and they love to hit all the beats.

Working out to a song,
can quickly make you very strong.

---

And f you neither have a pet squirrel or a rat,
just become a cool cat.

And s it is often stated,
always try to stay hydrated.

Use a tiny LCD interval timer or app,
and let that be your workout map.

And Whatever you do, never sit at a gym,
as that does nothing for the core or limb.

Jut keep moving along,
an hour of dancing won’t feel very long.
