Pixels are simple little transparent creatures,\
and they don't really have many features.

For one, they have no hair,\
and are totally square.

---

They sure love a good meal,\
and it is always a big deal.

For, they eat color to survive,\
and usually live in a huge hive

---

They used to be big and rare,\
but now they are everywhere.

And although they got a lot smaller,\
they never stopped eating color.

---

Since pixels are transparent,\
they food they eat is **really** apparent.

And they love nothing more,\
than a color you can't ignore.

---

In the prehistoric days,\
they went through a pretty tough phase.

Back then computers barely had a screen,\
and few saw more colors than sixteen.

---

Pixels like hide and seek,\
and they love looking unique.

In the old days pixels had to eat the same food,\
and that was, never, good.

---

Their preferred meal today,\
is a good video without any gray.

Their favorite food however,\
is a painting in which they can last forever.

---

Pixels love sleeping,\
even if people are always peeping.

Thus, it should be our preference,\
that we pick colors directly from our photo reference.
