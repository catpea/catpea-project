We are all born to become,
great warriors, battle or not.

But then made tame,
by job, seriousness, and beauty. 

But we must take the harder road,
and embrace the warrior within.

---

And every warrior,
begins with a powerful outfit.

And this here challenge,
challenges you...

To keep wearing it,
EVEN AFTER HALLOWEEN.

One month, or one day,
if you are way too cultured.

Is not enough to show the word,
the warriors we are.

---

From now on, and hence forth,
every day!!!,

Is a show the world,
who you are today.

---

Begin building your superhero outfit,
immediately.

And don't put it away,
after Halloween, but rather improve it.

Add commuters, swords, wings,
lasers, and even weaponize interesting smelling perfumes.

There is no limit,
there is only the new age of superheros.

It is 20 20 something,
this __is__ the future, more than we know.

---

And it is time for a fashion revolution,
that is cool for a change.

We must all recognize,
our strengths and weaknesses.

Our inner creature,
from squirrel to bear.

And discover our,
super hero names.

And build, build a series of,
unique suits or Armour to bear your symbol.

Set a noble world changing aim,
and figure out your superhero name.

Do not delay, 
join the most incredible fashion revolution, today.
