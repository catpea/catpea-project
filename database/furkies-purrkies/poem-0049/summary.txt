School Is Not For Us - Run, Child. Run From The Bus.
Sunday • April 26th 2020 • 7:10:06 pm

Don't let them put you on a school bus.

Tell you parents, school is crazy!

And anyway,

they shouldn't be so lazy.

You will need all the games,

and you memorize *no* presidential names.

You demand a trip to every national park.

because you will not spend you life in the dark.

You will need every audio-book ever made,

and only then will you go through life unafraid.
