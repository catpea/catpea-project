The Space Kittens From Oumuamua: Attention All Humans!
Saturday • January 7th 2023 • 10:30:15 pm

We have have been watching you,
and this here is a message from our entire crew.

By far... and with such grace and ease,
you are one of the most magnificent species.

But you have made a major mistake,
and today, __everything__ is at stake.

You are neither soldiers nor workers, dumb or trapped,
you are simply, all too quick to adapt.

---

Please, you must understand,
that in order to learn you cannot just pretend.

You have to redesign your system,
as you are each capable of infinite wisdom.

If you haven’t got a 1,000 books on your book shelf,
than your Diploma is just an insult, to yourself.

Time has come to open a new door,
ending poverty, fake-education and all war.

---

What you really are,
is the beautiful children of a long gone star.

And for all those intelligences born of star dust,
love of wisdom is a hard must.

Learn to see your Earthly family as one,
as one people under a new sun.

You must each become a great being,
wise, and noble, and farseeing.

Learn to see yourself across vastness of space,
as one humanity, and one embrace.
