We have have been watching you,
and this here is a message from our entire crew.

By far... and with such grace and ease,
you are one of the most magnificent species.

But you have made a major mistake,
and today, __everything__ is at stake.

You are neither soldiers nor workers, dumb or trapped,
you are simply, all too quick to adapt.

Please, you must understand,
that in order to learn you cannot just pretend.

You have to redesign your system,
as you are each capable of infinite wisdom.

If you havenâ€™t got a 1,000 books on your book shelf,
than your Diploma is just an insult, to yourself.

Time has come to open a new door,
ending poverty, fake-education and all war.

What you really are,
is the beautiful children of a long gone star.

And for all those intelligences born of star dust,
love of wisdom is a hard must.

Learn to see your Earthly family as one,
as one people under a new sun.

You must each become a great being,
wise, and noble, and farseeing.

Learn to see yourself across vastness of space,
as one humanity, and one embrace.
