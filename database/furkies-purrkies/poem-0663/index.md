My classy ski mask and lightweight bag arrived today,\
and though it wasn't too cold I took them out for a test run.

It was dark by the time I got ready,\
but I had a wonderful time.

My dancing helped me become a tiny bit more flexible,\
and this helps me jog by rolling the ball of my foot.

While I am a perfect slowpoke,\
it felt really good to use that jogging technique.

When I tried using it before it felt awkward,\
like there was no reason to go through the extra steps.

But now I can really feel the difference,\
between ruining on the front part of my foot and gently rolling the back.

It made me look like I was just walking in a hurry,\
but it felt wonderful.

Though I prefer the city,\
I ran towards the I-275 trail for a change.

There is a bit of stretch there without city lamps,\
and it felt magical to run in the dark.

Even though there were plenty of cars,\
getting away from the city lights is kind of relaxing.

I hopped on the trail by the highway to take in the dark a bit more,\
and before I knew it my eyes were used to the night.

It is rare that a night is just dark,\
I could see all the trees just fine.

I turned off my dim headlamp,\
and there was no trouble seeing the path.

Just a few steps from a busy road,\
and on to a trail by a highway.

And you can already feel nature,\
and all the noise aside it felt fresh and healthy.

I shuffled few extra feet and turned around,\
to head back to the city.

My fancy winter hat kept me warm and cozy,\
and an extra layer of flimsy long sleeves made the temperature just right.

I probably need a break from jogging for a couple of days,\
but I could have ran a slow and relaxing 10K easy.

It is dancing that strengthened me,\
made me more flexible.

Jogging, helps to earn the endurance for dancing,\
and dancing grants strengthens and flexibility.

It is a perfect kind of easy training,\
and both feel great.

I use light dumbbells for both,\
and this helps with arm and shoulder strength.

Dancing more than jogging helps to develop abdominal muscles,\
there are all kind of little benefits coming from both.

Jogging calls for nature,\
but dancing is done best on a stable surface.

Combined and bicycling, and hiking,\
it all becomes more like a happy little adventure than a healthy workout.
