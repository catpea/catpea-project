Just the moment you set your foot in school,
you need to get ready as plenty will go wrong.

The very notion that you can be marked with a grade,
is one of the greatest errors in education.

You are not a grade, you GPA is nonsense,
you are not supposed to memorize or cram anyway.

Teachers will just use your grades,
to pretend that they are working.

The principal will use the school average,
to retain accreditation and keep getting money.

And a punishing grade, even without ridicule,
marks your teachers as completely mad.

The notion that you can be motivated with grades,
that have impact on your entire life, is cruel.

And it plays right into tricking you into memorization,
so that you brainlessly pretend you have an education.

---

Quietly sitting in the back row,
waiting to get out of school.

Will destroy the world,
all of its beauty, all of its love.

All of its future,
all of Humanity.

Real education,
requires that you follow your curiosities.

And it is precisely as unique,
as you are, it is an extension of you.

Above all,
you must begin learning on your own,

because trusting others with something as profound,
as your very own programming, that connects to all within you.

That is just dumb,
it is reckless.

You are not a vessel to be filled,
you are meant to grow all the way up.

All that you learn must be precisely arranged,
so that it is relevant, and that you can use it in life.

There is no sitting in rows,
memorizing random nonsense.

You find what calls to you,
and begin learning starting in the days that it was invented.

The early days of physics, or mathematics,
or programming, or philosophy.

And out of love for what moves you,
you learn, reconnecting the dots.

Philosophy especially will teach you what it means to be Human,
how hard we searched and to what great heights we rose.

Understand humanity to learn to love it,
protect the hard earned steps, and the foundation you stand on.

You are not meant to accept,
a world divided.

And your home and the homes of your children can’t be safe,
until we stop pointing missiles at each other.

Which in it self,
is an act of great wisdom, and love of Humanity.

---

In these desperate times,
you have to learn programming.

As this will grant you the ability to tell,
real and authentic education, from an ineffective impression of one.

---

When a teacher says, open your books to chapter one,
you need to go into alert mode.

You need to ask, but what about me,
my curiosities that already pave a path of education.

“If my authentic education, is inconvenient to you,
what are you doing as a teacher?”

“Are you pretending to teach, hiding behind equally ineffective,
text books and principals?”

Because there is no way,
all the students will find the material relevant.

One education fits all is fraud,
and it is not about the teacher getting paid.

It is about students not receiving real education,
without real education, you won’t even know what to stand up for.

---

You can gently explain to such a person,
that their education was stolen from them.

But they always return to their job,
and their days.

Because it is not within them, to understand,
that to grow all the way up.

Means;
to become, a great being.
