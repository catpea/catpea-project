Letter To The Teacher Community
Thursday • August 12th 2021 • 4:24:05 pm

I was one of your students...

I know you can't make the necessary changes,\
but that does not mean you should **continue** doing what you do.

First of all I know a lot of you hate the kids,\
you hate the way the challenge you.

Well, they challenge you, because they can read your mind,\
they have a tendency to ask:

"What would I have to think,\
to match the behavior of the teacher"

And then they act,\
like they have no idea who you are.

They don't actually care to know everything,\
they really just care about one question.

Whether or not you are a great being,\
that deserves the respect you demand by means of the chain of threats.

In case you missed it...,\
you are meant to be an inspiration, but you are a threat.

You are threatening the children with bad grades for which they will be belittled and punished at home,\
and you are threatening then with being held back for which they will be made fun of and punished at school.

The one thing you don't do, is threaten them with anger, when you are angry at them,\
they see the real you, and they get a confirmation that in fact nothing you do matters.

The internet is full of videos with titles like "Teachers Yelling At Students",\
"teachers losing their temper".

And yes, "Students Yelling at Teachers",\
which shows not how bad the students are, but the results of their parents and your actions.

It shows a mind wired for survival,\
adapting to threats.

We could sit here for hours picking the good from the bad,\
I am going to cut that short, very short.

And I am going to say this to you,\
[everything you do is bad, all of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY).

I will give you two examples...

The moment children are marked with grades they stop learning for real, and focus on grades,\
once you split a subject into 45 minute pieces smeared by tests, it becomes meaningless noise that can only be memorized.

This idea of you having a bad day in school, because the kids weren't listening,\
or acting properly is madness.

You are putting them in a toxic environment,\
and you waste their time, with subjects that cannot be integrated into a unified whole - which is what a healthy mind requires.

And have you noticed,\
that they measure their intelligence with your GPA?

It does ...

...niqueness out of the minds,\
this brick in the wall nonsense must stop.

Quit,\
and become the Great Being that they all once wished, you already were.

What follows is am incomplete list of Humanity's True Teachers,\
of Humanity's True Leaders.
