Helping The World Grow With Adaptive Audio Books
Tuesday • May 13th 2025 • 8:20:03 pm

Hi, AI. I am trying to save the world. I know it is being torn apart by indoctrination, science-denial, nationalism, racism, and ineffective education.
All combined together this creates a world where people can’t communicate. Where they are incapable of reaching agreement. It is a perfect breeding ground for evil, and war.

So, I have an idea to save the word. Like really save it for real.
I will create a program that uses LLMs to create Audio Books that teach young people through audio alone, with an optional PDF. But not just any Audio Books. My system re-builds an Audio Book on a specific subject, to match the listener, and make it both accessible and fascinating (not just appealing or interesting).

Today we are testing this idea, by creating just the table of contents of just about 15 items, for a book about learning JavaScript Programming.

- Chapter names should be fascinating, slightly longer than usual. With a short high-information density and fascinating description (but keep it serious, you are speaking to the young people who will repair the world). This is one of the key concepts in out quest towards cultural convergence on wisdom and in world peace. Even though the reader has already picked programming as their interest. The chapter names you create, have to be informative, and pull them in deeper, fascinate them.

- Remember that you are teaching JavaScript, so you have to gently work in fundamentals. But make them fascinating sounding, or use tiny challenges. So instead of a chapter on reading files. Say learning about reading: writing and appending files, by building the tiniest WikiWiki. Though please word it better than I did.

1. Generate a table of contents, for a person who is very impatient. And just wants to create a folder with index.html, that contains a script section. Cover Novice Friendly OOP, encourage use of Electron where the user can use Node api to make remote requests and scrape with cheerio. Provide a chapter with CSS selector recipes, and then three to five application ideas. But make the initial application chapter names focused on electron, and then instead of jumping to a browser based project, make a couple of WebExtension chapter names.

2.  Generate a table of contents for a person, who l...
