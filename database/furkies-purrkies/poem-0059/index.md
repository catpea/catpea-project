We must Always wisely choose Maximum over Minimum,

because the minimums will attack our mind and body.

When hoping to live life to the fullest,

we have to choose the big things very carefully.

Health, is an example of a big thing,

everything we do, must stand in support of it.

Time, is a big thing,

everything we do, must count.

We must frequently ask,

"Is this event harming or helping me?"

We must frequently ask,

"Will this matter in six months, or next year?"

We must ask,

"What are the regrets of my older self?"

Because only you can judge yourself,

you must grow in wisdom, and age gracefully.

Do not miss the point of life -

You are meant to become a Great Being.

You are to search and find the Light of Your Life,

and discover a way contribute to Wisdom.
