What If Programming Is Everything?
Sunday • March 23rd 2025 • 9:04:09 pm

Programming is very easy,
just a handful of rules.

And it is very much worth your time,
because it can map everything.

From [annoying to read math][1],
with crappy ambiguities.

All the way up to logic,
simulation, and visualization.

---

You will learn more about biology,
by creating an OOP program.

And flat out have kittens,
by doing math, or rather…

Having math done,
for you.

---

We didn’t even scratch,
the programming surface.

It has been the real of nerds,
because teachers can’t fake it here.

If you aren’t taught for real,
the programs will not work.

And even their so called “tests”,
where you make some chicken scratch.

Reveal the quality,
of the education.

---

The teachers,
will eventually admit they lie.

Probably by asking,
how were we supposed to know…

What teaching was,
when no no one was teaching.

---

But you have no excuse,
because you are not allowed.

To place your learning,
in other peoples hands.

It is an old trick,
a specialty of witch doctors.

Refined by uneducated kings, priests,
and popes who sit on empires of dirt.

---

You have no right,
to give your learning away.

You have no right,
to betray your older self.

---

Unless you have better things to do,
as you maybe more mature...

Not learning programming,
in the age of helpful AI, is very sad.

Because AI will explain everything,
and in beautiful ways.

Especially, if you tell AI,
that you are just learning.

And that you need help,
with initial understanding.

---

Programming makes you very smart,
it makes your mind sharp as the hecks.

It makes chess, math, even physics,
look like child's play.

As in the world of programming,
you can hit play…

And make it all come to life,
your biology, your new physics.

New kinds of minimalist AI, Bots,
State Machines, Multi-User Dungeons.

---

You get to innovate all the time,
[new inventions, multiple times a day][2].

Come to the infinite world of programming,
where there will never be any limits.

Think of something,
you could never understand.

And tell AI,
to write a minimalist JavaScript version of it.

The AI will explain everything,
from math to relativistic time dilation.

The universe is teaming with divergent species,
so as long, as you think in the fourth dimension.

[The old games, are all waiting for upgrades][3],
and all the sprites are belong to you.

Learn the most popular language,
and do all the things that no one has ever though of before.

Let your teenage days,
be filled with constant breathhroughs and profound discoveries.

Go on, change the world of programming,
and let it, change you.
