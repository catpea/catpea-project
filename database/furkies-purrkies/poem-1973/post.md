I saw my grandma looking out the window,
as there were some riots.

My country was moving away,
from crazy old ways.

And she said,
that it smelled like potatoes.

I have always ensured to take potatoes seriously since,
both as a tool of war, and riot.

It took me over 40 years to understand,
that out neighbor cooked potatoes for his animals.

But even so, after all those decades.
I will always take a potato as a serious threat.

And the mark,
of a powerful warrior.

---

I then asked my grandma about war,
she explained that ”war is what men do”.

I was just a few years old,
and I already knew that these were clearly no men.

No rational creature,
could do what they do.

When my bullies found me,
I associated them with war.

And I have always ensured,
that they are not hurt.

Walking away,
and becoming a great warrior by doing so.

---

My grandma, as all grandmas,
was a holy saint.

And she said,
exactly what I needed to hear.

My grandfather,
did not help me with my bullies.

After so many decades,
I think I’ve become wise enough.

To hear him tell my grandma,
leave it alone:

“It is the best thing,
that could ever happen to him”.

He meant that my bullies were just kids,
they would not hurt me much.

He fought in war,
he was a real warrior.

---

He probably believe in people,
but also was that they have predispositions.

And he would not believe in changes beyond that,
short of some hard lessons.

One of my book friends,
also believes that.

That there exist “the ones”,
and that others do not fare well.

---

I asked my older self to keep me company,
when the bullies would start whispering.

I answered that call,
many times.

I sat next to my little self,
making sure I was never alone.

But I also visit my book friend,
by his bunk bed.

I see what he sees, I see the ones along with him,
breaking their last piece of bread.

My friend created an entire philosophy,
from breaking that bread.

Based on how the ones,
chose not to become beasts.

---

There is a lot more wisdom than can be seen,
but it requires that you have a great soul.

The wisdom is denied to monsters,
it becomes warped and falls to pieces in the hands of bad people.

---

Your first and fore most duty,
is gathering all your wisdom.

Do not worry about your friends,
avoid your bullies, thieves, and monsters.

They are temporary,
wisdom is permanent.

Each is a piece of code,
that creates a living sum.

Infinitely greater,
than the pieces you find.

---

That wisdom contains many messages,
inscribed by great beings, and warriors.

They are all waiting for you,
to find the wisdom, and to rise as they did.

---

You will have to end war,
of course.

But that can only be achieved,
by its prevention.

The rise of the warriors of wisdom,
who control the future.

By helping each human being,
grow all the way up, until they too become a great being.

It is an equality of wisdom,
culture of greatness.

---

Do not be scared of school,
because you are charged with becoming a teacher.

All the injustice and fake education you will face,
is to serve as fuel to your works.

Like my friend, you will not need a notepad,
the books you create will come from your greatness.

You are about to face a world marred by madness,
by make-believe-education, by pretentders.

And masses of mediocre men,
who just want nothing but praise for a job well done.

You will not be alone on this journey,
all the world’s great beings will watch over you.

And many other great beings,
will be growing up right along with you.

You don’t have to break your last piece of bread,
but you must reject a broken world.

And rise,
to built a better one.

Sir,
would you mind...

You who stand at the threshold of your lives, let me tell you what I have learned from the darkest corners of human existence: You are never alone, and nothing meaningful is ever truly lost.

I discovered that even when everything is taken from you; there remains one thing that no one can steal: your freedom to choose your response. But you, blessed ones, you begin with so much more. You begin with choices not of mere survival, but of creation.

The world you inherit is indeed broken in many ways. But here is the secret: It has always been broken, and yet, in every generation, there arise those who choose to be healers rather than harmers, builders rather than destroyers. You are called to be among them.
Do not wait until you are older to begin. Your responsibility starts now, even as a child. For you see, the prevention of future wars begins in the playground when you choose kindness over cruelty.

 The transformation of education begins when you hunger for real learning despite the inadequacies of your schools.

Life is not primarily a quest for happiness, but a quest for meaning. And meaning is found in three ways—through creating work or doing deeds, through experiencing values like truth and beauty, and through the stance we take toward unavoidable suffering. You have the privilege of beginning with the first two, storing up strength for whenever you might need the third.
So gather your wisdom eagerly, my young philosophers.

Read voraciously. Question boldly. Create courageously. For in doing so, you are not just preparing for your own life—you are preparing to be a light for others who will walk in darkness.

The future belongs to those who believe in the meaning of their responsibility. You are those believers. You are never alone in this quest.
