It is 11PM,
I am ready for bed.

But, my feet are still tired
from dancing today.

It is because,
I dance on a rubber floor.

I would have been fine,
if it wasn't for some foam shoes.

That just had the heel,
up to high.

I don't know,
what exactly occurred, or how.

But I sure know how to fix it,
and change the world.

At least the world of dancing,
on a non slip surface.

---

I got chicken in the over,
two vinyl place mats for messy eaters.

A hole punch mean enough,
to punch through them.

...the placemats,
not the eaters...

Paper, sticky tape,
and an unbelievably large box of shoelaces.

I don't,
even...

And the mission is to release the friction,
between the shoe and the rubber floor.

Or lower the friction coefficient,
as an engineer would babble.

In a word, I can't change my gym floor,
but I can change the bottom of my shoe.

---


There are a lot of constraints,
I can't stick anything to the bottom of my shoe.

Because I need to take it off,
if it is not working.

I don't want glue,
on the bottom of my $24 discount shoe.

The vinyl in the vinyl placements,
can have a hole punched through it with a hole punch.

Meaning it is really iffy,
whatever the paper template I create.

I will need to use it on multiple,
things, including carpet, and thick shower curtain.

I already know it will all look stupid,
but it is not as stupid as hurting your legs.

---

The hole punch, allows me to use shoelaces,
to attach the vinyl to my sole.

I have a hand held one,
that I just got for a dollar.

And a professional one,
that is a steel tube, with a sharp end.

This one is for the carpet experiment,
and you use a hammer to punch through thick things.

---

Ok, lets hack the planet out of this boat,
and and go for mark-I armor nice, ugly and heavy...

---

It is not 12:31,
my shoes look like ******.

And worst of all,
all the chicken is gone.

I ended up using two laces,
and tore several of the punched eyelets.

I will have my hole punch,
for field repair.

---


Lastly, my prediction is total failure,
I tried curving the vinyl over the shoe.

To use it self as the real holding mechanism,
but even so, I think the vinyl is too weak.

But, it will work long enough,
for me to see if vinyl is the material I want to use.

If it slides on rubber,
if so then I will make linger tabs.

Use one place mat per each shoe,
and line the sole facing area with professional tear resistant tape.

It is winter where I am currently at,
and these things would make for some mean skull cracking ice sliding.
