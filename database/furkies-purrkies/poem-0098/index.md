Take all that you are,

and forge a suit of armor.

Paint, or sculpt, or cosplay,

we are always all to human, but we are unique.

All your armor decorations, and Your medals of honor,

will show you as you are.

---

Keep growing up, keep adding to your story,

may your armor reflect the sun.

---

And let go of the Poker Face,

that's not really You.

If you must, show everyone how Mighty you are,

how Great and beautiful your Heart Is.

Keep growing up, book by book,

poem by poem, art by art, and triumph, and failure.

Build a mountain of worn out running shoes,

and torn up bodybuilding gloves.

Fill Coffee Shops and Galleries with you Art,

with your Sculptures, or Music.

Let who you are protect you from misfortune,

be authentic, always lead your own way, and never follow.

Show The Word,

Who You Are.
