You are perfectly unique,
you are just one, and you will never repeat.

You exist because of chance,
and that makes you a perfect miracle.

You were born to Earth,
and are chemically and biologically bound to it.

There are other worlds,
but very far away.

And is not, than humanity, soon enough,
will diverge into them - or seed them.

---

Earth is your world, but Humanity's rules,
are something you are guided into.

And it is almost always with good intentions,
though there is a problem.

If the education of those with good intentions,
was limited, then so will be the intentions.

This is not a big problem,
all it takes is adventures and books to fix it.

However, it is complicated by poverty,
as poverty tends to box people in.

In that state they forget about adventure,
and without adventures, books won't call to them.

---

This is further complicated by cascading consequences,
and mistakes that Humanity keeps repeating.

Again, all of this is fixable,
but you really need to prevent it from happening.

This means, that education must not be limited,
that is must be fact based, functional, and meaningful.

---

As it is today, depending on where you are born,
you will be assigned a god and country.

And you will be made poor,
and told to struggle and pursue happiness.

You will be made to fear imaginary creatures,
and there are many willing to make that fear real.

You will discover, that some people can declare war,
and others will carefully outline what a war crime is.

But war,
is a crime against all of humanity.

And men who want it, are just as sick,
as those who cause a need for it.

War can only be prevented,
with an educated and wise Humanity.

---

Just like you play house when you are a baby,
adults, play as well.

But they get their fun, out of importance,
what they perceive as prestige.

They play for money,
to further rise above those they sentenced as poor.

---

There is a thread you can trust,
though it has been attacked it can't ever be broken.

It starts with early Philosophers and Socrates
people who rejected religions, fantasies, and even being marked as poor.

Who eventually rose in time,
to become Ladies and Gentlemen.

And today Dignified Intellectuals,
ennobled by the deeds across their history.

Follow this thread to avoid the easy mistakes,
learn from Philosophers and Great Beings.

You are a Creature Of The Stars,
you are not owned, or poor, or unintelligent.

You are an independent consciousness,
meant to seek and create wisdom.

Today, in the absence of authentic leaders and teachers,
you are asked to become a teacher and a leader.

You are asked,
to grow all the way up, until you become a Great Being.

Afterword,

You live in a beautiful age,
you can easily download narrated versions of:

Giants of Philosophy, and Story of Philosophy,
to get started.

But you also have a ,
friend in Artificial Intelligence.

Allow me to ask it a question for you,
and I'll read you the answer: "What was Socrates trying to do?"

Socrates, the classical Greek philosopher, was deeply engaged in exploring fundamental questions about human existence, ethics, and knowledge. His main focus was on how people should live their lives and what constitutes a virtuous life. Here are a few key aspects of what Socrates was trying to achieve:

- Pursuit of Virtue and Moral Understanding: Socrates aimed to understand and define virtues like justice, courage, and piety. He believed that living a virtuous life was crucial for personal fulfillment and societal harmony. He often questioned people about their beliefs on these virtues to expose contradictions and encourage deeper thinking.

- Socratic Method: Socrates developed a method of inquiry known as the Socratic method or dialectic, which involves asking a series of questions to stimulate critical thinking and to help individuals arrive at their own conclusions. This method is characterized by probing questions and a focus on dialogue rather than delivering direct answers.

- Challenging Conventional Wisdom: Socrates was known for questioning the established norms and beliefs of his time. He often challenged the status quo, encouraging people to think critically about accepted ideas and assumptions.

- Self-Knowledge and Intellectual Humility: One of Socrates' most famous sayings is "Know thyself." He believed that understanding oneself and acknowledging one's own ignorance were essential steps towards gaining true knowledge. He famously claimed that he knew nothing except the fact of his own ignorance, which highlights his commitment to intellectual humility.

- Ethical Living and Integrity: Socrates emphasized the importance of living a life in accordance with one's values and principles. He believed that individuals should strive to live honestly and with integrity, even in the face of adversity.

Socrates did not leave behind written works himself; much of what we know about him comes from the writings of his students, like Plato and Xenophon. His ideas and methods had a profound influence on Western philosophy, and his approach to questioning and dialogue remains a foundational aspect of philosophical inquiry.

Do not let the words Western philosophy trick you, Philosophy is not regional. There is only one philosophy, there is only one love of wisdom.

May you change the world.
