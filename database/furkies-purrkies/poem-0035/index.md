Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty,

I've been fixing bugs all day, and I feel dirty.

Now, that I fixed them all,

I must admit, I had a ball.

But, computers are slow,

My CPU is slower than a BBQ.

I tried to build a rhyming dictionary,

but it came out as an 8 megabyte webpage,

and nearly erased the internet.

In computers, everything is really bad,

but this never makes me sad, I am glad.

And now,

I took a shower,

and smell great,

my only wish,

is that I already ate.
