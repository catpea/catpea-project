I labor up in Michigan,
often called the land of “Never Again”.

But, I like it up here because of the lakes,
it is quiet and you get plenty of brakes.

But, there isn’t much to do,
most people just sit around feeling blue.

The rest of us gather in herds,
to watch the birds.

This year it is the Canadian geese,
the dinosaur bird that want no peace.

Somehow they know,
that there isn’t going to be much snow.

And they form long gaggle convoys,
making much noise.

---

Nobody really knows what they want,
they seem to just want to flaunt.

As if climate change was their doing,
and even more trouble is brewing.

---

At lest the seagulls flew back home,
to their tropics island where they roam.

If we are to trust the word of mouth,
the other birds just walked south.

---

I am sure a good snow will come,
and the geese will eventually go home.

But I will be sad, certainly a tad,
no one’s going to be glad.

Because until the weather gets hot,
the geese are all the fun Michiganders got.
