Right about this time of the year everybody is preparing for gym,
but gym is more challenging than doing it right by going Hiking and Camping.

Do not expect that you just add gym to your life,
and get a fit body out of it.

You also have to remove things,
your stressful job, kitchen appliances for junk food, and busy schedule.

Yes, it is impossible, but no, you will have to reorder your life,
because a healthy lifestyle comes first.

That, is how you show your loved ones that you care about them,
and that they can trust you you will be there for them.

Obesity, overeating, overwork, stress, preventable diseases,
all add up to shorten your lifespan, your kids notice this.

While all the great things things you do are awesome,
you kids need you to be around for 90 years, not 45.

Hence, healthy lifestyle must come first,
every person in this world extends themselves, but you got to back.

You may thing to yourself it is too late, because of the choices you made,
now you are blocked off, and can only live 45 years and not 90.

But that is a mistake, that I say out loud,
so that you don’t have to.

You are poor on purpose, due to incompetent politics,
the people who put you in this debt should worry about it.

You must be allowed to have a family,
and a full measure life to take care of your self and your loved ones.

That absolutely means, that your health comes first,
and may not be sacrificed or traded for any reason.

Gym is a compressed version of jogging, hiking, and bicycling,
it is all the bad without any of the good.

This is helpful, when you are bodybuilding,
when your fitness is beyond that of an endurance hiker.

But gym is not helpful,
when you are there to save your life.

---

We are walking machines, no engineer has yet invented as graceful of a robot,
we are gradually evolved for it, it is out starting exercise.

It is the first thing you do, when you get off the couch,
and growl: “That’s fucking enough!”

You walk, you can get your initial legs by walking to the store,
walking in a part, or even at a mall.

You can walk at the gym, but be careful of the coughing people,
too many people are packed in a small space right after holidays.

---

Once you have your legs, you need to learn about camping and hiking,
the internet is full of hiking and camping videos.

They cover every subject from winter survival and ultralight hiking,
all the way up to building extravagant shelters with all kinds of extras.

And while you should start with shortest trails first,
a picnic basket, narrated books, and the weekend warrior style.

---

You must be aware of the Triple Crown of Hiking,
as that is the super highway towards improving your mind and body.

That is the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail,
and The Continental Divide Trail.

For many it is just a day dream, but non the less,
that kind of multi year, multiple thousands of mile hiking.

Is where our bodies transform in just a few months,
here you walk for 20 miles a day, and you never complain.

--

Your down to earth scaled down version,
must vever-ever be squeamish about distance.

Don’t just walk a mile, think about the big hikers,
and walk multiple miles every day.

And work up your strength, co carry a day pack,
and maybe add some wrist and ankle weights.

But while pushing yourself is what fitness is mostly about,
the beauty component is critical for your returns.

That means, you should section hike all the trails you should find,
always looking out for the beautiful side of nature.

It is the beauty and changing scenery,
that will make all the difference.

This year, don't just go back to the gym,
become a hiker, learn camping, and set your eye on the Appalacian Trail.
