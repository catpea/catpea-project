Your obedience is the perfect solution,
to all of other people’s problems.

You can be turned into such a perfect fixing tool,
that no one will ever notice they are lying to you.

If you fall for it, then some part of you,
will come to be dangerously close to becoming forever lost.

To regain it, you will have to abandon all you have built,
and start from the beginning away from the toxic and inauthentic.

If you keep hanging on to liars or manipulators,
they will eventually rob you of your mind.

---

You have to center yourself,
come together in all your strength.

If you can’t come up with a road ahead,
then just become a dot, the beginning of a line.

---

At first, you can start detoxification,
under the cover of vacation.

Right at the end of those two weeks,
you begin restoring yourself, almost finding yourself.

Two weeks is not enough,
you will need three months.

But the vacation helps you over your greatest enemy,
the first three days of doubt, the doubt lasts about a week maybe two.

And it does return when you feel alone,
and manipulators are crying out to you for help.

---

Help is a form of art, and it comes deeply from within a persons heart,
if you come to close to a liar, you will love them until there is nothing left of you.

To quote Brene Brown, "Before you become a hero to others,
you must first become a hero to yourself."

And Ayn Rand, “Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you desire __can be won__. It [DOES] exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's yours.” (end quote)

But you must first, turn your dot into a line,
an endless authentic adventure through your beautiful and authentic life.

Only the world’s most beloved philosophers,
especially the modern ones who live beautiful and authentic lives, have the advice you need.

Most of them are hidden, some so well,
that stupid teachers laugh at the idea of them being more than writers.

---

In your authentic adventures forward, no day should pass,
away from narrated books written by great beings.

You can tell where the philosophers are hiding,
by whether or not the books they create, or speeches they give, change peoples lives.

They aren’t hiding because they are sacred,
Socrates shows Philosophers have infinite courage.

They are moving themselves out of the noise,
of stupid teachers, and dumb hecklers and mindless contrarians.

The easy arguments that liars make,
are a putty made of thought garbage that overworked people are particularly susceptible to.

This putty is distracting enough to muddy up philosophers,
into silence them, by spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

A lot of bestsellers are fake, having a bestseller label on a book,
is good money.

It will take you some effort, to find the philosophers,
it is not as easy as looking at he top selling narrated books.

Often, looking for five star titles in the “Other listeners also bought” section,
is your best bet.

---

You can’t extend your line far without narrated books,
because you will just be repeating the hardest journeys that were already made.

What you need is to stand on the shoulders of giants,
to make decisions based on the wisdom you inherit from thousands of life changing books.

---

As a human being you are meant to grow all the way up,
you are not allowed to stop at any time, you just keep rising.

You are not to sacrifice yourself for the well-being of others,
you are to bloom and flourish so that you become an inspiration.

Everyone is charged with the challenge of rising,
it is not about pats on the head, good grades, and paychecks.

Those are meaningless things, you are not a puppet,
not a cog in the betrayal of students by infective education.

The only reason why we are stuck in poverty,
is that the politicians are too uneducated and arrogant to end it.

---

The meaning is in you growing all the way up,
until you become an unbreakable, unique, great being.

Until you too start synthesizing and combining thoughts,
that can be weaved into life changing books.

The feeling you feel during vacation is not the rested you,
it is you, the unlimited you…

“Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark”
