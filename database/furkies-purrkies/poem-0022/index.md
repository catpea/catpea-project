Captain's Log: Day Seventeen of Quarantine.

Found two bugs in code, and got stuck in between.

I was supposed to be working on a Sound Machine,

but spent the noon formatting the code to keep it clean.

I can't believe, there is a bug in my code,

its probably in octicons, because I am using node.

Worst of all, I can't see it fail until I publish,

because sapper likes static as not to be sluggish.

So here I am, finally dressed up like Superman,

Debugging code, blind, like a veritable caveman.

I did a bit of soul searching,

then followed with some researching.

Now, I am sitting here, contemplating if I need a cape,

wondering if I should follow up with an Audiotape.

I could finish up getting in shape,

and completely change the workout landscape.

I am serious about making a workout tape,

I really want to get in shape.

What if the workout required wearing a tail?

Would it become like super holy grail?

I would walk the street and people would pale,

"Sir! Why have you done this?

You, are a Whale!!!"
