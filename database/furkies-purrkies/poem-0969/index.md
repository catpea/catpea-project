Face the EventEmitter,
something that should be fundamental to every language.

Just like you can say class for objects,
or try for error trapping, you should be able to say listen and emit.

But often companies are calling the shots,
if you are given the power of the even emitter…

the crappier companies will lose control over their software,
if they ever try to fire you.

I once called programming with Event,
thought programming, as in all you need is your imagination.

But don’t do that, you will need colorful thin-tip markers,
and large drawing notebooks, not sketching but the heavier drawing.

You just draw lines and circles,
emit and listen.

Now let us get practical,
Svelte the top programming technology for 2022…

Wants you to make a pyramid of your data,
the big application state or memory object on top.

And then you send down its fragments,
to the components that need them.

That works if your pyramid is two levels high,
and you never need to integrate with anything outside of your control.

Like an external authentication system or a nifty remote database,
or flat out web sockets, which are amazing for server browser communication.

---

You have to use the EventEmitter here,
it penetrates all the pyramid walls.

You don’t have to follow any structural advice,
the EventEmitter lets you program a spiderweb of communication.

Here the now aged Junior programmers,
and call the EventEmitter evil as they do with the GOTO and Eval statements.

But they are just crazy, they spent their entire career,
in a cubicle for their mind.

Don’t invent, don’t innovate, don’t question, don’t lead,
don’t think outside of the box, do what you are told.

All we can say to them,
is that what they needed was not simpler code, but a more visual editor.

The EventEmitter puts a WalkieTalkie in your Svelte components,
now data can be send independently of the structure of UI components.

And vice-versa you will never have to structure your UI,
to distribute your data – and how crazy that one is.

To close with an example, you create this beautifully complex properties pane,
multiple forms, lots of little buttons.

But to connect it to the rest of the application, you only listen to one event,
selected, as in the thing that will display it properties in the properties pane.

And to save the object with now altered properties,
you just say, emit save, and attach the new changes.

This is simple, beautiful, powerful,
it will have you building your own applications and companies, in no time.
