Boys are doing it wrong, they lift too heavy,
and thus can’t lift for long enough to ever lift heavier.

You must start in the beginning of the rack with 3 or 5 pounds,
and focus on establishing a 30 to 60 minutes non-stop dumbbell workout.

Lift in-front, to the side (in a comfortable way), above your head,
and do some bicep curls.

Do 5 to 10 lifts and switch to the next dumbbell exercise,
where the muscles you just used rest and you work on some other group.

Do not swing your weights as boys do,
use your muscles.

When 5 pounds makes you stop for a few seconds too frequently,
switch to 3 pounds, and then go back when you are rested.

Do not just listen to music, you need to hit every beat,
one beat up, next beat down, as that is how you enter a dance trance.

Aside from helping you move your entire body, as dance is an instinct,
this will distract you, like driving a car does, and hours will turn to minutes.

You will need to select slow music at first, Country, Romance, Ballads,
as you get stronger, you can go up to Pop, Euro Dance, Techno and Rave.

The faster you move, the more fat you burn,
the heavier you lift, the bigger the muscle.

Now listen carefully, lifting heavier, right at the edge of what you can handle,
that is likely going to be 7.5 pounds per hand, for an hour non-stop.

Will initially completely overwhelm you, but not because it is heavy,
but because you don’t have the endurance of moving heavy for an hour.

In order to break through that you will need a class of stop watches,
called interval timers.

It is just two countdown timers, rest, and workout,
that go around in a preset number of rounds, such as 10.

You can find apps that are free and without ads,
that will beep over your music.

And there is also a clip on version,
where you clip it on your belt or wear it on your wrist.

Here you use the vibrate mode,
and again focus on hitting every beat of your songs.

People use them wrong, because the point of an interval timer,
is not some weird workout routine, but slow elimination of the rest period.

Interval timers help you simulate,
what joggers do naturally as they gain their endurance.

Over time, they stop less and less,
eventually eliminating all their rest gaps.

That is what you have to do,
and he is how.

Start with the lightest weight, and measure how long,
you can lift it non-stop, while cycling your standing dumbbell exercises.

If you don’t cycle your exercises, you will approach something similar,
to cutting of your circulation, and be forces to stop early.

Boys do that, they think that is muscle failure,
but that is just a disruption to their circulation, and they fool themselves.

Enter your workout duration into your timer,
and then, do your best to guess or measure how long you need to rest.

To have the same workout again,
and enter that as your rest duration.

If you can workout for one minute, need to rest for two,
and set your rounds to 10, that it (1+2)*10, a 30 minute workout.

You may need to refine your numbers for a couple of weeks,
but as soon as you get it right, trim the rest period down by a little bit.

And keep doing it, until you eliminate it completely,
and can gently dance non-stop to slow music by cycling dumbbell exercises.

A non-stop workout, or a warrior workout, shows results weekly,
and because this is a standing routine and your are always balancing your body.

You get abdominal muscles, leg muscles, and shoulders,
without needing to perform special exercises.

Because you are not isolating muscles, like boys do,
as you grow muscle, your body is always aesthetically balanced.

Be sure to drink plenty of water, and add vegetable juice to your diet,
to take care of your muscle function.

If you get a Charlie Horse anywhere, back, leg, shoulders,
that means, more vegetable juice, but not too much.

Lastly, you will get sore muscles for the first couple of weeks,
that is not because of gym, but because you were out of shape.

Your musculature is just re-starting,
and it is going to ache a little bit, ignore it, completely.

Nobody I know ever complained about this,
people are so happy from seeing results, they forget about it, as soon as it stops.
