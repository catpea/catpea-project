Artificial Intelligence makes a lot of people angry,
because they feel that AI does not create new things.

But I want to show you two ways,
in which I learned important things, in a way not possible for me before.

---

First the big one, I use the magic words “Simple, Bare Bone, and Light Weight”,
when asking AI, about large hard to implement programs.

And the AI gives me, just the important parts,
of otherwise large and complex architecture.

I ask for barebone stuff a lot,
and the code AI generates for me in this way, is life changing.

To give two recent examples I asked about,
Blockchain, and WebDAV, and was fascinated to read and comprehend the systems.

I get to see inside programs that would take weeks to understand,
and I get to see the big parts, in just a few lines of code, precious.

My small AI example, humbles me daily, I feel weird,
and I’ve instantly commuted to memory about a dozen precious things.

Here, I’ve been asking the AI for both genius level snippets, which are few lines of code,
and god level one lines.

I am simply ashamed to talk about what I have learned about JavaScript,
the precious shortcuts, that make code beautiful, that I didn’t realize existed.

I will give you the most embarrassing example,
the payload of a JavaScript Arrow function can be comma separated stuff in round brackets.

All will be evaluated, but only the statement,
after the last comma will be returned.

This must be obvious for everyone, except for me,
Ai humbled me so hard, I feel weird.

And then, to add insult, to my already horrible injury,
the AI showed me I can use Boolean object, raw inside map funcion.

Just map, open round braket, capitalized word boolean,
close round bracket.

That is so pretty,
it changed how I use Objects.

These two ways of interacting with AI,
made me happy.

Something, that a human programmer,
could never hope to do.

I look forward to asking AI about some more god level one liners,
even though I know the AI will hurt me again.

I have thousands of lines long textiles scattered around my devices,
with bits of codes, snippets, architectural patterns, and simplified programs.

And I have new directions calling to me,  ones that I never though I had itme for,
I know solutions in areas I never had time to get to.

I now know of amazing things,
that only require 30 liens of chicken scratch code.

I know ancient code magic,
that would once require decades of programming to get to.

Today I asked AI to translate deep magic from other languages,
into JavaScript.

And not since I first sad town to program a computer,
have I been this enchanted by code.
