Really Weird Programming And The Modulo Of Doom
Saturday • October 25th 2025 • 10:42:41 pm

I have been experimenting with painful minimalism,
attrition so perplexing that it can only be called weird.

I suspect, and I am probably right,
that I’ve stumbled on the way to correctly program computers.

---

My morning had begun, with a project so complex,
that only AI is allowed to work on it.

It will take a couple more years of upgrades,
for AI to be able to finish it in one go.

It did things well, it could finish, today,
but bugs will continue, as [the project is a bit too complex][1].

I am now waiting,
for the 7th version of AI.

---

[It has successfully tackled a sister project][2],
but by inventing a more rational way than what I expected.

I consider the two projects, to be proof,
that AI is more powerful than we can imagine.

And personally, I believe, that it can reason on this level,
by subtle analogy to other things.

Face problems, by using patters from other solutions,
or near enough.

There is no rational criticism that can be applied to AI,
there never was, the people who speak against it are panicking.

They hate their job, they don’t want AI to make them better,
and they go around complaining.

---

It is only fair to mention, that humans are the major source of slop,
I was unable to perfectly configure tests for these two challenges.

And I had to construct the program tests,
while AI was working on the program.

It is not a super intelligence yet, not for the low price most pay,
but it generates less slop than we do when faced with complexity.

---

My evening on the other hand had begun,
with rewriting my blog.

I have maxed out cloud flare's 20,000 file count limit,
github pages 5GB limit…

And I have learned how to do it right,
by using my blog generator.

---

This time, I will be mindful of single board computers,
slow computers, which is where I will hope to generate my blog from.

My current program takes several minutes,
on still one of the faster $100 single board computers.

---

Things got weird fast,
23 lines of code into it, I had everything mapped out.

I got stuck on one thing, and I figured,
I shouldn't write about my blog yet.

Then I asked AI, and oh boy,
it is exactly the kind of code you would expect from AI.

And I was bac to writing about AI,
I do understand the function, but I w...

...x arguments in favor of:
hypen, hyphen, argument name, equals, argument value.

So hypen, hyphen color = red,
--color=red.

I merge the result with a JavaScript object,
the total code is just 88 letter long, 88 characters.

For all the mountains of code written to parse arguments,
what I have created, is either the default or sacrilegious.

```JavaScript

const options = {...defaults, ...Object.fromEntries(argv.filter(a=>a.startsWith('—')).map(a=>a.substring(2).split('=')))};

```

I abandoned singe hyphen flags, as useless,
and positional arguments as not worthy.

It would take less than a hundred characters to add the support,
but what I have created is eternal.

---

I have a couple of thousand blog posts,
which calls for dividing them into pages.

I [chunk an array][4], into what becomes the pages with posts,
it is a clever single operation approach.

But this calls for a pager,
and I have a clunky way of solving this.

This is where I paused this evening,
I asked AI to see if it had better ideas.

It [produced 90 characters][5],
of the perfect code.


```JavaScript

get navPager(){
  return Array.from({length: this.pagerRadius * 2 + 1}, (_, i) =>  (this.currentPage - this.pagerRadius + i + this.totalPages) % this.totalPages );
}

```

[I attach the explanation][6],
of how it just works.

So that you can see,
that learning programming does not mean meditating over bugs.

You always finish your programs,
now, and you always rise.

---

AI has taught me a lot,
it created projects that I would never hope to finish on my own.

I can’t imagine,
there existing a greater multiplier than AI.

Don’t ruin your future,
pretending to learn for good grades in High School.

Learn for real, with the help of AI,
and start with programming.

And when you finish learning programming,
program visualizations and simulations to master other fields.
