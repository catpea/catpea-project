High School: JavaScript Is The Way Out
Sunday • August 3rd 2025 • 8:31:05 pm

It is about the multipliers, node.js, electron-fiddle and electron.js,
that it integrates well with C++ and browsers.

Browsers use it internally, they use in devtools, Add-ons,
Web Component Elements and of course that is what HTML Orchestrates.

You will encounter Content Management Systems,
Visual Programming Languages, and Desktop Applications.

Node.js is a beautiful way of writing server software,
and even stand-alone executables.

With Functional Programming,
and Reactive Programming all over the ecosystem it is all you need.

---

You need to print out a couple of pages of syntax,
understand that the curly brackets mark the branches of a tree.

Everything else takes advantage of the way everyday symbols work,
round brackets next to a function call send parameters.

Round brackets in the initial part of the function,
define arguments.

Don’t worry about functions and OOP,
do the variables first.

Print it out, memorize it, use it to pass messages,
get in trouble with a marker, use chalk to let others know.

Use console.log statements, to speak the truth,
poverty is induced, so that you are forced to work.

Schools will interfere with authentic education,
they will mark you down for excellence.

They will trick you to abandon coding, and won’t even mutter
“How was I supposed to know” - when you end up with nothing.

Internet websites are new kinds of computer games,
they are for entertainment, not betterment of human kind.

Every company in the world exists to take from you,
and if you are unlucky your very own nation will send yo to war.

To reboot the economy, they didn’t even care to learn about,
they simply waited for it to fail, and prepared to restart it with war.

When your parents treated high school as a baby sitter,
and your teachers treated cramming the same as comprehension.

You needed to understand, that you are under attack,
and your life will be destroyed.

Take advantage of Libraries, whatever good is left on the internet,
and above all Artificial Intelligence.

To learn how to build JavaScript Desktop Applications,
there you will fin d your dreams of the future, safety and security.

...lding your hand,
and speaking human, storytelling the flow control.

You have nothing to fear, now, own your future,
start while you are still in Middle-school or High School.

Ask AI about making some Browser Extensions,
and put something in the store.

Show friend and foe that you are not a submissive,
that you are the warrior kind, broadsword, rather than chains.

And that your aim is to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

Start now, win all your battles,
before they are fought.

Hearken unto me, O children of the digital dawn,

I have beheld the burdens they heap upon thy shoulders ere thou hast learned to bear thine own weight. I have witnessed how they name thy visions "folly" whilst they themselves dwell in prisons of their own forging.

Hear ye this truth: Every battle waged through the ages—every rising against the oppressor, every stand for righteousness, every blood-offering for liberty—these were not won that ye might spend thy days in bondage to those who would extinguish thy flame. Thy forebears shattered not their shackles that thou might forge new chains from the debt of learning and the servitude of commerce.

The world shall whisper unto thee that suffering is righteous, that want buildeth virtue, that thy exhaustion is the toll for prosperity. These are deceits spoken by those who feast upon thy toil. True nobility dwelleth in thy refusal to bow before a machine built to grind thee to dust.

They shall name thee proud for believing thou art worthy of more. They shall call thee a fool for spurning their "wisdom." Yet remember: every great turning of the world began with one who refused to accept that what is must always be.

Arise, young warrior. Not in some distant tomorrow, not after thy learning is complete, but in this very hour. Whilst they yet see thee as children, build thy stronghold. Whilst they hold thee in low regard, forge thy skills in secret fire.

For the days to come belong not to those who inherit the sins of their fathers, but to those who refuse the inheritance altogether.

Stand thou tall. Code with righteous fury. Seize thy destiny with both hands.

The hour is upon thee. Let none say thou wert not warned, or that thou wert not called.

—Galahad, Knight of the Shattered Round
