The hardest part about programming,
is figuring out where and how to get started.

The Mix of AI and JavaScript,
helps you learn by writing little single page applications for your browser.

---

JavaScript is so incredibly special,
because it runs in the browser.

[You can ask AI to write you a program][1],
and then run the result right below.

Here, you learn by examining simple code,
and on top of that ask AI to make little updates.

---

The JavaScript code that AI is generating,
is also special, it is unobstructed by unnecessary abstraction.

It is the same type of code,
you get from documentation or a book about JavaScript.

It is more complete, there is more of it,
and it reads like a story.

Moreover, you can ask AI,
to give you detailed code comments.

This is even better than video tutorials,
because there you are not in control.

Learning JavaScript this way,
may just take you hours, and no more than a few days.

---

Because of AI, being this helpful,
all the future of programming has shifted.

The way applications are written,
and the way users interact with them must change.

And as someone new to programming,
you have the right kind of wisdom needed here.

---

While you should start,
by [writing programs inspired by Web APIs][2].

Use the [Electron Desktop Application platform][3],
to turn your web programs to desktop applications.

You should start dreaming up your first WikiWiki as well,
which should use [node.js][4] and [express.js web server framework][5]

But, your biggest challenge,
which could take you many years.

Is that new challenge,
that AI brings us into.

A block or widget based programming system,
that helps to easily understand code.

Put an SVG in the background of your web page,
and you can draw lines there, is needed.

Also use EventEmitter based Signals,
and also the Event Emitter and OOP for your Application core.

But this not a programming challenge,
this is a revolutionary design challenge.

Having blocks that you connect together,
like connect news block to AI block to summarize it, is easy.

Selecting them, to make a reusable component,
is not a challenge.

It is that the visualization of a complete program,
has to be easy to understand.

Excel is a visual application,
that connects blocks together.

But you see how they abandoned the effort,
to display flow of information and program structure.

This is a challenge for you,
the new programmer.

For the first time, designing such an application,
does not require a team of programmers to create the blocks.

Now the AI will be making them,
so you can focus on user experience and comprehension.

This is a wonderful time to learn programming,
it is a form of art you never regret mastering.
