Don’t Lift Heavy, Lift Long: A Simple Jogging Workout For Girls
Monday • March 31st 2025 • 9:48:36 pm

This is a two level worout, the second lever where you lift at the gym is optional,
and the simplest explanation for the first part is: Slowly Jogging With Light Dumbells.

---

The boys copy each other, they don’t want to stick out,
they don’t want to be called out, or laughed at.

What follows is a tiny description of how to do it right, from the start,
and we are going to rely on a nice workout program called [Couch25K][0].

Jogging is good for you every which way,
and the only difference between jogging and bodybuilding is weights.

You will need dumbbells, which you can get used for a couple of bucks,
from a local donation store, or used junked store.

But you can also use wrist weights, a weights vest,
and even ankle weights.

---

You should weight yourself down from the beginning,
as we are mixing slow jogging and bodybuilding.

Not so light, that you can complete the Couch25K with more,
and absolutely not so heavy, that the weights will force you to stop.

Jogging with dumbbells is a full body workout,
if you care for more muscles you need to do standing dumbbell exercises.

These are dangerous while jogging, so for bigger muscles,
head for a gym, and give yourself a workout that is as intense as jogging.

But now, cycle between [Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1]. [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2],
and the mighty [Overhead Shoulder Press][3].

But this is more about broad shoulders and large muscles,
rather than a balanced physique.

And the same rule applies, not so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy, that you must stop.

The heavier you lift the bigger your muscles will get,
though you will begin moving slower.

When moving fast, you use up your stored energy faster,
you put on muscle and burn fat to make it stick out.

---

So the thing that boys are doing wrong,
is not working out for long enough.

And because you start with light dumbbell jogging,
you very quickly start lifting 3 pounds per hand for an hour.

And some weeks down the road, go up to 5 and 7.5,
you workout for an hour, boys for a minute or two.

You will show results weekly,
boys will show them yearly.

---

In their defense, they do fall into a trap,
because, your first time, even if you work out wrong, you get muscle.

So they just continue doing it wrong,
in hopes of more muscle.

But because they start in the middle of the rack to show off,
they can never lift for long enough to lift heavier – they corner themselves.

---

Since you start in the beginning, and lift for an hour, your body slowly adapts,
to 3lb. Per hand, 5lb, and 7.5lbb, and so on.

You give your body time, and don’t get cut off,
growing larger muscles just about the same week that you go up in weight.

Afterword,

Please note, that this text or audio comes with a link to a Couch25k podcast.
That you can download as mp3 files.

The podcast features a trainer telling you when to walk, and stop, cool down,
slowly eliminating your rest periods, until you are slowly jogging non-stop.

Carli won’t tell you to bring dumbells along, that my advice,
and remember to check every week or so, if you have adapted.

By checking if you can slowly jog with the next weight up,
be sure to move by 2.5 max (per hand), never go up by 5 as that is way too heavy.
