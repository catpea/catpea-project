First of all,
gym is a boring place.

If you need to lose weight,
you need to walk the big trails.

Appalachian Trail, Or Pacific Crest Trail,
or The Continental Divide Trail.

Look, our knees were not made,
for jogging while being large.

Walking, walking on soft terrain,
where every day is more colourful…

Is the only real way,
to restore your body.

---

You think you can’t,
because of family and money.

But actually, you must,
because if you don’t do it now.

You and your loved ones,
will lose much more, if you wait.

If you are large,
you need to pack.

Go shopping for hiking gear,
right now, get in your car.

You do not want the consequences,
of obesity.

---

Let me repeat,
that gym is too boring for weight-loss.

That you need something more colorful,
that you need the great trails.

Let us now visualize,
what we know to be true.

Joggers and bicyclists,
have muscular legs.

Can you imagine that?
Now imagine what would their legs look like.

If they pedaled or jogged,
for 20 seconds.

Then stopped,
played with their phone.

Stared at the floor,
and two minutes later.

Jogged for another,
20 seconds.

And again,
but now after the third time…

Developed uncontrollable,
explosive incontinent urge.

To just sit for now a whole 15 minutes,
and stare, and itch, and scratch, and pass gassssssss.

Would our joggers and cyclists,
have big gainz? Would they still be muscular.

No, but I know what you are thinking,
what if I lift heavy, real heavy.

Then, you will not be able to finish,
your exercise.

The heavy weight,
will shut you down, because you are too weak.

Now, I want you to visualize,
a backpacker with a heavy crushing backpack.

And a football player,
with an all too heavy weight-west.

Can they walk far enough,
for their muscles to receive signals to adapt.

No, in fact, each time, they will try,
they will walk less and develop injuries.

Need days off,
and combined with how boring this is, quit.

Heavy weight, means,
they can’t get anywhere.

Now,
how to do it right.

Aside from inducing a music trance,
by lifting to the beats of a song.

And using an interval timer,
to stay distraction free…

While closing the rest gaps,
so that like a jogger you go no stop.

You have to go all the way back,
to 5lb dumbells.

Or if you are luck and your gym has them,
3lb. weights.

It does not matter if they feel heavy or not,
next week or two you increase weight.

But only so that you can continue lifting for,
just about an hour.

Here the interval timer,
will help you eliminate rest if any.

Interval timers increase your endurance,
basically.

And here on the third week,
lifting 10lb per hand maybe too crazy.

So you lift for 10 or 20 minutes,
and once you must stop.

You switch to the lower weight,
and thus begin resting, to try the heavier again.

This is the equivalent of jogging,
yes, because you are going light an non-stop.

But it is also the real way to go heavy,
because while you can handle 3 or 5 lb for an hour.

10 will be very heavy,
especially as you begin listening to faster music.

But it it not impossible,
and after to you can switch to 12lb.

And then the big 15,
watch your back.

3 or 5 lb. is also how you,
strengthen your back.

Your body needs you to lift light,
before you get to 12 or 15.

And forget sitting,
there is no sitting.

Dancing or flexing and twisting,
with dumbbells, keep your entire body healthy.

---

And finally visualize,
that copy cat.

That just watches some videos,
and does what they do.

They come in and grab onto 15lb.
Lift for 20 seconds and sit.

And here you are,
where it took you years to get to 15lb.

Who do you think will gain muscle faster,
30 lifts in 5 minutes or 15,300 lifts in three hours.
