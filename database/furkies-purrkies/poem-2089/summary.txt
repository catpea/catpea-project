# The Confessor's Shadow

## Würzburg, 1634

### Part One: The Boy Who Counted

Marcus Aldric was twelve years old when he learned to count the innocent.

He worked as a clerk's assistant in the Malefizhaus - the witch prison of Würzburg - fetching ink, sharpening quills, carrying the heavy ledgers from room to room. The work paid three pfennigs a week and kept him fed since the plague had taken his mother and the war had taken his father to a Swedish pike somewhere near Breitenfeld.

The clerks called him "little shadow" because he moved so quietly and because he was always there, in corners, watching.

They did not know what he was watching for.

The ledgers fascinated him - not for their content, which was monstrous, but for their *silences*. Page after page recorded confessions: names of accomplices, descriptions of midnight flights, details of congress with demons. The consistency was remarkable. Every accused witch, it seemed, told the same story.

Every single one.

Marcus had read enough to know that when every story matches perfectly, someone has written the story in advance.

### Part Two: The Question That Could Not Be Asked

The chief clerk was a man named Johann Weiss, who had grown fat on the work of the trials. This was not metaphor. The accused's property was seized upon arrest - homes, livestock, savings, everything. A portion went to the Church, a portion to the Prince-Bishop, and a portion to those who administered the process.

Weiss ate well.

One evening, Marcus was copying a confession while Weiss reviewed the day's proceedings. The document described how the accused - a widow named Margarethe Baumann - had flown to a Sabbath on a goat and there kissed the Devil's hindquarters.

Marcus's quill paused.

"Herr Weiss," he said, keeping his voice carefully empty of tone, "in three years of these proceedings, have we ever found evidence of such a flight? A witness who saw the goat? Tracks in the mud? A neighbor who saw her leave or return?"

Weiss looked up. His eyes were careful.

"The confession is the evidence."

"Yes, Herr Weiss. But the confession comes after the strappado. After the boots. After—" Marcus stopped himself. "I only wondered if there was corroborating evidence. For the records."

Weiss set dow...

...eputations technically intact.

It was not justice.

But nine hundred people had died in Würzburg. No one else would.

### Part Ten: The Ledger Remains

Marcus Aldric lived to be sixty-three years old.

He never married. He spent his life as a scholar, a keeper of records, a teacher of young people who wanted to understand how institutions could be corrupted and how corruption could be exposed.

He kept his ledgers until the end.

On his deathbed, he gave them to a student with instructions to copy them, to spread them, to make sure they survived. "The machinery of forgetting is patient," he said. "It waits for us to die and takes our memories with us. Do not let it win."

The student asked him if he had any regrets.

Marcus was quiet for a long time.

"I regret that they were never punished," he said finally. "The administrators. The bishops. The men who grew fat on seized property and called it holy work. They died in their beds, respected, their crimes forgotten."

"But you stopped them."

"I made them afraid. I made them stop. I did not make them answer for what they had done." He closed his eyes. "Perhaps that was never possible. Perhaps all we can do is document. Record. Remember. And make it harder for the next generation to pretend they do not know."

He died that night.

The ledgers survived.

### Epilogue: The Question

Four hundred years later, the documentation remains.

The trial records of Würzburg. The property transfers. The confession transcripts. The *Cautio Criminalis* of Friedrich Spee. The testimony of physicians and lawyers and priests who saw the machinery and could not unsee it.

We know what happened. We know why. We know who profited and who died.

The only question is whether we will remember.

Whether we will recognize the machinery when it reappears - as it always does - wearing new clothes, speaking new languages, claiming new justifications.

Whether we will see the pattern.

Whether we will be shadows or whether we will look away.

The ledger is open.

What will you write in it?

*In memory of the nine hundred and one of Würzburg, and of all those across the centuries who were destroyed by systems that profited from their deaths. May we prove worthy of their memory by refusing to forget.*
