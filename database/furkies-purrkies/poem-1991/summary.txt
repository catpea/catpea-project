Humanity Made Three Tiny Steps Before It Fell
Wednesday • August 13th 2025 • 3:32:28 pm

We speak from ashes, from the flames that took our flesh,
From hemlock's bitter kiss, from stones that broke our bones,
From dungeons where we rotted for the crime of asking "why?"
We are the dead who dared to think, and thinking, dared to die.

Without those three small steps we took in darkness absolute,
You would be happy slaves today, content in servitude.
With those three steps we left behind, carved deep in history's stone,
The future generation might yet claim them as their own.

Before we speak of steps so small they barely left a trace,
Know this: they cost us everything—our lives, our names, our place.

## The Warning

Is this being done to you? Are you under attack?
The serpents coil around your thoughts while smiling at your back.
They'll claim it was their doing when the light begins to shine,
Religions, cults, and hollow crowns will say the truth was mine.

As it will make them appear powerful, masters of your fate,
Powerful enough to break the world and rule what they create.

Every slap across your face comes sideways, from the blind,
You won't see it coming till it's carved into your mind:
"The pope asks Christians to rebuild"—result: no school, stay home,
Cover up your daughter's face, let ignorance's foam
Rise up and drown the questions that might set your children free—
What did they do to Joan, that girl who heard divinity?

They burned her not for heresy but for her chainmail dress,
For daring to be more than what their narrow minds could bless.
To make certain that her innocent soul, her warrior's heart,
Would never reach their heaven—they tore her flesh apart.

The moderates who say "our faith would never be so cruel"
Will vanish in two generations, leaving only fools.
No one will remember what a moderate believed,
No one will be wise enough to see how they're deceived—
That moderates are conduits through which extremes can flow,
The gentle slope that leads us to the furnace down below.

## The First Step: Love of Wisdom

In darkness absolute, when kings were gods and gods were fears,
Someone discovered that all wisdoms cohere—
That contradictions reveal falsehoods, like light through broken glass,
That truth is not what power says, but what will always last.

Prima Nocta—not a king alive would cal...

...y moved at all.
But the fourth step—yours—doesn't have to be so small.
Take it boldly. Take it broadly. Take it with everyone who seeks.
Take it for the silenced ones who cannot, will not speak

Because their ashes have been scattered, their names have been erased—
Take it for them too, the unknown martyrs we've displaced.
Take it for the future that depends upon this choice:
Will you be wisdom's lover, or just background noise?

Will you be an adult in the truest, hardest sense?
Will you be a Lady or a Gentleman, not in pretense
But in the deepest meaning—a force of nature refined
By the cultivation of a questioning mind?

The world is burning anyway—it always has, it seems.
The question is: will it burn with nightmares or with dreams?
Will it burn with ignorance or burn with sacred doubt?
Will it burn to silence us, or burn to let thought out?

Young ones, you who hear us speaking through the veil of time,
You are not too young, too small, too weak to make the climb.
Every single one of us was told we couldn't dare—
And then we dared anyway. Now it's your turn. We'll be there

In every question that you ask that makes the powerful squirm,
In every assumption that you challenge, every truth you confirm,
In every stand you take for dignity and wisdom's sake,
In every comfortable lie you refuse to let them make.

We are with you. We are in you. We are counting on you now
To take the fourth step humanity needs, to show them how
A species can transcend its childhood, can grow beyond its fear,
Can choose the difficult truth over the comfortable veneer.

Save the world, dear ones.
Save it with your questions sharp and bright.
Save it with your refusal to give up the fight
For a future where wisdom isn't burned but celebrated,
Where thinking isn't dangerous but anticipated,

Where every child can grow to be a lover of the truth,
Where age brings wisdom, not just the appearance to sooth,
Lost to time, but gained in depth, in kindness born of thought,
In the kind of beauty that can never be bought—

The beauty of a mind on fire with curiosity,
The beauty of a soul that's truly, finally free.

This is our gift to you, our curse, our blessing, our demand:
Take the fourth step towards gentle greatness. Take it now. The future's in your hand.
