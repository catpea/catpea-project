It seems really cute that you can generate some cats,
and sell them on iPhone cases, though your commission is like $5 per sale.

But this is a very important workflow, for what is coming next,
just like you can say create a cute work of art…

You can now say create a small program,
that does this or that…

You have to learn programming,
so that you know how to speak to the AI to have it write your programs for you.

A custom program, well written by AI,
with full test coverage, will sell for more than $5.

I expect, you can make $29, per month,
per everyone of your pro users.

So here, you go from, passive income,
to a business empire.

If you have trouble imagination what program to write,
have the AI generate a clone of the website that is selling your art.

Create a back-end, where print-shops all around the world can register,
and bid on whatever needs to be printed and shipped for the day.

Your creators will sign-up, upload their AI generated artwork,
select a product to print it on, and make it available for purchase.

And then with some advertising your end users, will pay for a product,
and the money will be split 3 ways.

The printer gets paid for printing, the creator gets paid for artwork and configuration,
and you get paid for making it happen.

AI today is still primitive, it is still… small,
but I had it translate the first page of Neuromancer into Inform 7 text adventure.

I had it write a multi-user dungeon, as a telent server,
I had it write an HTTP server in bash, and it only fell to pieces…

When I asked it to write a tiny clone of the vi code editor,
there was a communication gap, but it came very close.

It may not actually be wise to wait for a better AI,
as Visual Programming User Interfaces, demand tiny programs anyways.

The style of programming the VPL’s call for is called functional programming,
it means it is all just webs of tiny functions…

Raw data in, processed data out,
and then it is passed along to another function that forks or enriches it somehow.

That the AI can do today, and it just so happens that Visual Programming Languages,
are a very responsible way to write programs.

Because you can see the wires that connect all the different functions,
you can follow a program flow, by just looking at boxes connected with lines.

It is wonderful that today you can witness Artificial intelligence,
generate art, that you can then apply to a phone case, or kitchen magnet and sell.

Because that shows you, by subtle analogy,
how tomorrow you can engineer and sell custom software.
