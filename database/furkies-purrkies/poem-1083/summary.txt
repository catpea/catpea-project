A Quantum Of Greatness; Or, The Beautiful Ghosts Still In The Machine
Thursday • February 16th 2023 • 3:20:53 pm

In quantum physics, you cannot measure an outcome,
without influencing it.

The particle you send to measure the position of your subject,
will gently nudge it out of its way, thus altering the outcome.

Please understand that this is a failed experiment,
and that what you need is not a warped quantum of ghost, but to listen to their original works.

The following series of tiny poems, has no authorship,
and there is no one here to worship, and in some wretched a universe has gone dark.

You will have questions, you will find all the answers in the 10,000 narrated books,
which are your right, and most valuable inheritance - and don't you dare, pay a cent.

Speak to the real authors, every one of them loved you and saw you as their highest hopes and dreams,
find eves book that changes lives and you will discover the authors and their their authentic messages.

Finally, please believe me when I say, that when your books are read in the far and distant futures,
they will reawaken some part of your spirit; make no mistake, it is your duty to become a writer so that your treasures are never lost.


# A Life Of Dignity

I believe that the prison of poverty and cultural or religious indoctrination is a result of the failure of society to recognize the value of individual freedom and autonomy. We must create an environment where individuals can make informed decisions and exercise their own judgment without the interference of outside influences. We must also ensure that everyone has access to effective education and resources that can empower them to make decisions that will benefit them and their communities. As long as poverty and cultural or religious indoctrination exist, we are denying people the opportunity to have their basic needs met and to make their own choices about how to live their lives. We must do better to ensure that every person is given a chance to achieve success and to lead a life of dignity.

### There Are No Shortcuts

There are no shortcuts when it comes to success. There is no magic formula or silver bullet that will take you to greatness. It takes dedication, discipline, and hard work. Also, it's important to remember that failure is a part of life, and it's okay to fail, as long as you le...

... succeed in life. We should abolish all forms of testing for the sake of testing and shift the focus to authentic assessment of student learning. We must also recognize that education, like all of life, is a journey of learning that never ends; a journey that must be supported and guided by a sense of curiosity, creativity and critical thinking.


### Valued And Respected

We can end ineffective education by taking it back. Go back to the basics: books, chalkboards and freedom for students to explore and discover, not being troubled by teachers looking over their shoulders, same old lectures and standardized tests. Instead of the focus on jumping through hoops, the focus should be on giving students the opportunity to think, act and create. We have to encourage real learning, in an atmosphere where a student's individual personality is valued and respected.

### Scrape Our Knees And Open Our Eyes

We can't grow all the way up to become great beings. We can only grow as far as we are willing to scrape our knees, open our eyes and stomach every confusing and sobering moment that comes our way. We must learn to embrace the darkness, the silence, and the unexplainable, then somehow be brave enough to take it all in and make the most of each moment. We must learn to be all right with being wrong, to not fear mistakes, to forgive and to never stop trying. That's how we become great beings - by taking the good and the bad, the ugly, and that wild and sublime something, and molding it all into something that makes a difference and sets us apart in a world that desperately needs truth and love.

### Power Of Minds - A Concluding Word From From The Ghost Of Socrates

How can they reach even higher?

My answer to this inquiry is that young people can become powerful and unstoppable when they exercise the power of their minds. A person can only reach higher to transcend limits when they put forth effort to learn, grow, and challenge themselves with new ideas and perspectives. This process of pushing one's boundaries of understanding and acquiring knowledge is what makes one powerful and unstoppable. Furthermore, if young people are determined to continue this journey, they will be able to reach and even surpass all of their goals.
