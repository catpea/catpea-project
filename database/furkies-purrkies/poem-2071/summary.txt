Cautio Criminalis: The Shadows Know
Friday • October 31st 2025 • 8:36:23 pm

(Apologies, narration is not yet tested for mistakes. Halloween ends in 70 minutes and I must hurry.)

**Prologue**

The Vatican Secret Archives smell of centuries - parchment, incense, and the particular mustiness of truths kept too long in darkness. I shouldn't be here. The credentials around my neck belong to a visiting scholar who died three weeks ago in München. No one has updated the database yet.

My hands shake as I pull volume after volume from the restricted section - the files they don't digitize, don't catalog, don't acknowledge.

I'm looking for Friedrich Spee.

Not the official Spee - the Jesuit whose *Cautio Criminalis* in 1631 dared to call witch trials what they were: systematic murder of innocents. Not the sanitized saint they've made of him. I'm looking for what they did with his legacy afterward.

What I find instead is a file marked *Protocollo di Gestione della Percezione - 1935-1945*.

Perception Management Protocol.

Inside: production budgets. Distribution agreements. Studio correspondences on Vatican letterhead. And photographs - dozens of them - from film sets I recognize: *The Wizard of Oz*, *Snow White*, early XXX productions.

There's a memo, dated March 1939, marked *STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL*:

*"The successful repositioning of witch imagery from historical reality to fantasy entertainment has exceeded expectations. American audiences now associate witchcraft with children's entertainment rather than Church history. Recommend continued funding through intermediary cultural foundations..."*

My breath catches. Another document, earlier - 1936:

*"Cardinal [REDACTED] advises that given the renewed interest in medieval history prompted by European tensions, proactive measures regarding Inquisition narrative management are essential. The emerging film medium presents unprecedented opportunity for cultural revision..."*

**Chapter One: The Uncomfortable Question**

Three weeks earlier, I wasn't breaking into Vatican archives. I was teaching medieval history to undergraduates who barely looked up from their phones.

"The witch trials killed between 40,000 and 60,000 people," I told my class at Georgetown. "Mostly women. Many were midwives, healers, women who owned property. The trials peaked between 1550 and 16...

...ut Sarah's video. About millions of young people learning to recognize manipulation, to ask uncomfortable questions, to remember what institutions want them to forget.

They'd grown up watching witch movies. Now they knew what those movies cost.

That's not victory. But it's not nothing either.

**Epilogue: The Long Work**

The Vatican didn't fall. Institutions don't work that way. But three years after the story broke, things had shifted:

- Mandatory public reporting of abuse allegations in forty-two countries
- Independent oversight committees with survivor representation
- Financial transparency requirements
- And most significantly: a generation of Catholics who'd learned to question

Claire spoke at a survivors' conference in Rome. Thousands attended. She told her story - not the abuse itself, but everything after. The isolation. The PR machinery. The playbook they'd followed to exhaust her.

"They had a formula for making us disappear," she said. "But formulas only work if people don't know they're being used."

In the audience were historians, journalists, survivors, and young people who'd never stopped asking why. Why witches are funny. Why abuse is complicated. Why justice takes so long.

They were learning to recognize the architecture of institutional forgetting. And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

I think about Friedrich Spee sometimes. How he must have felt, documenting innocence, knowing the machinery would grind on regardless. How he published anyway.

Truth doesn't save everyone. But silence condemns everyone.

The work of remembering is never finished. The work of accountability is never finished. But every person who refuses to look away makes the machinery a little slower, a little louder, a little harder to hide.

We don't get to choose whether institutions protect themselves. But we get to choose whether we help them.

I teach my students about witch trials now, and about Friedrich Spee, and about the systematic transformation of atrocity into entertainment. I show them the documents. I explain the machinery.

And every year, more of them choose to remember.

That's not nothing.

That's everything.
