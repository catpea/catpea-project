Workout music is a lot more complex than it seems,
and the benefits are literally staggering.

Getting your music right, is the difference between,
a good workout, and just showing up for a workout.

Workout music, can really cause you trouble,
and worst of all, the bad part sneaks up on you, without you noticing.

---

You see, songs are like non-rechargeable batteries,
if you’ve been working out to your favorite song.

It has actually been dragging you down,
a depleted song; is not only a dud, but it will rob you, of energy.

---

And during music selection, you won’t reliably be able to tell,
if a new song will help you work out or bore you.

In fact the best way to to find a good workout song,
is to look at “other users also liked”, or related content sections.

Forget about searching for good bass and crispy drums,
dull, rounded off songs, can also bring you energy.

Repeating snappy beats, without twists,
not just buildups and breaks, but twist will begin boring you quickly.

---

Basically, you have different ears at the gym,
and only about four days before a new song starts going flat, very quickly.

---

You have to use songs correctly, you must hit every beat during your exercise,
use an interval timer to mathematically eliminate your rest time.

I don’t want to say this, but stopping your routing in the middle of a song is bad,
there is a little you can do, though.

This is before you strap on an interval timer,
first workout during the slow parts of the songs.

And then invert that, the slow parts are usually a lot shorter,
than the more dynamic parts.

But you should really just use an interval timer,
you can probably get one for your phone for free.

Once you close the gap with slow songs, you have to find faster ones,
and continue earning your endurance.

You’ll quickly start running out of songs,
and here you will have to use Audacity, or ffmpeg to alter their tempo.

Changing the tempo of a song does not alter the pitch,
that is a different operation.

Old Rock and Roll, for example is too slow,
but once sped up those old songs can still pack a punch.

But, it is always a hit or miss, you will end up skipping songs,
some only seem like a good idea but are un-dancable.

Bringing back old songs that you haven’t worked out to in a long while,
doesn't work either, it may last for a day, or two…

But once you danced to a song for a few days,
you never get it back.

---

Finally, my advice is, get that darn interval timer,
and make sure it has a vibrate function.

This way you can listen to your music,
and fell the clip-on timer vibrate on your belt.

Rest periods are the first big thing in your way,
so keep your songs slow and keep narrowing that rest gap.

Once you don’t need to rest anymore,
spend a year or two with low-end dumbbells hitting every beat.

And then, don’t go higher, you need to go lower,
and push the tempo of your workout songs past 165 beats per minute.

Where you lift up with your left hand, and lower your right,
with a thrust that gives that dumbbell weight, and then do it the other way.

Lifting with both arms at the same time,
locks your body,where you become slow and rigid.

The trick, is really the combination of dancing, and lifting,
and nice, fresh and energetic music, almost picked daily.

You have to be all in,
mind and body, and soul; don't rush, it takes balance.
