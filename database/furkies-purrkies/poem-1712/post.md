A workout does not actually start at t eh gym,
because a workout is not about strength.

A workout is above all else about endurance,
that is what joggers first work on.

At first, it is hard to run the full jogging route,
but joggers keep training, and waiting for the body to adapt.

That is what you have to do first,
focus on eliminating your rest periods with the lightest dumbbells.

You should do that outdoors, and it is as simple,
as first walking, then power-walking and lightly jogging with dumbbells.

The gym version of that looks very similar to 1980’s aerobics,
it is mostly dance, all dumbbells, and lots of motion.

Once you can do it for an hour,
you must aim to up your dumbbells, by just two pounds.

This is why you eventually need the gym,
the dumbbells just become too needy.

It is easy to trip when you walk in a part with dumbbells over your head,
and if you do fall, your hands are busy and you can hurt yourself.

So, Once you build up your endurance for a non stop hour long dance workout,
then you go to the gym, and up your weight by to or two and half pounds.

Here, you can do bicep curls, lift to the side, lift in front, palm down,
and most importantly above your head, where your muscles rest.

This mixing up of dumbbell exercises to let muscle groups rest a bit,
is what helps you with you non stop workout.

You also need hard to digest carbohydrates in your system, like dried fruit,
and music, which will give you energy and focus.

When you lift to the beat of songs, you distract yourself away from stopping,
but you have to make sure that your songs are slow at first.

---

And your dumbbells should not be so light that you can lift more,
but not so heavy, that they make you stop.

Stopping to rest is slow fitness,
it reveals you are lifting weights that you body can’t yet handle.

And thus your body will not adapt as smoothly and effectively,
because you are not giving it a fighting chance to finish your workout.

---

That is how most people ruin their workouts;
with lifting heavy they will never grow bigger muscle because they can’t lift even heavier.

Their workout is about lifting a crushing weight about 50 times,
and then sitting around, waiting fo their body to recover somehow.

Their weights are so heavy they can’t add 5 more lifts and more 5 pounds,
and even if they did all that sitting around will not push their body very fast.

---

The point is to push, on all fronts, in various ways,
our bodies are a work of chaos, you have to send signals on all fronts.

So lift to the beats of slight faster songs, lift for 10 minutes more,
show up more frequently to the gym.

And of course lift heavier, maybe adding wrist and ankle weights,
and considering a weight vest.

Once you establish that hour long workout, you can only push by a little bit,
so all the little adjustments take months and years.

Eventually, your 3 pounds per hand, become 15 and 20,
and you still dance to fast songs.

A non stop workout fast transformation,
with large powerful and useful muscles that don’t require decades.

Don’t let anybody trick you into sets and reps,
heavy sets stop you all the time, they are very limiting, and slow to show progress.

A dumbbell dance, with gradual increase of intensity,
covers the full body, arms, legs, abdominal and back.

And because you are always moving, you never lose your slow jogging ability,
you can shuffle through parks for hours without ever running out of breath.

You get the muscle, the strength, the flexibility, the endurance,
fast progress, and most importantly without any real risk of serious injury.
