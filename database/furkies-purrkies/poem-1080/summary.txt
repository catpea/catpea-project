Bula, Lola, Lulu, and Kiki - They Save; Or Generating Products With Artificial Intelligence
Monday • February 13th 2023 • 10:29:51 pm

Aside from the title image, the four products come with a song,
which I am bout to roll with, and four descriptions.

The song and the descriptions are all generated by artificial intelligence,
this is why I call them products but not works of art.

Though I must mention, that the title images required several hours of work,
and getting a pen and tablet and learning how to use Krita makes product creation much easier.

Here is the song.

Verse 1:
Meet the girls, Bula, Lola, Lulu, and Kiki
They fight for justice, UBI, and real ed
They're a team, so nothing stands in their way
The world's future will be brighter today

Chorus:
Fighting fearlessly, they won't give up this fight
Guaranteeing justice is their one main plight
So they rally up, they stand tall and brave
Bula, Lola, Lulu, and Kiki they save!

Verse 2:
Justice will come, it'll be soon in sight
UBI and real ed, they stand to make it right
Come join them, and march along with their desire
Make justice the thing everyone does acquire

Chorus:
Fighting fearlessly, they won't give up this fight
Guaranteeing justice is their one main plight
So they rally up, they stand tall and brave
Bula, Lola, Lulu, and Kiki they save!

Verse 3:
In the midst of battle, they make sure not to quit
In the depths of despair, they still manage to hit
Striving for justice, freedom, and peace
Bula, Lola, Lulu and Kiki will never cease

Chorus:
Fighting fearlessly, they won't give up this fight
Guaranteeing justice is their one main plight
So they rally up, they stand tall and brave
Bula, Lola, Lulu, and Kiki they save!


And now I will read to you the four character descriptions,
again they are all dreamed up by artificial intelligence.

And I help it enter the state of confabulation,
by saying "Bula is a hero and a woman of rage. Please tell me more about her."

The AI was right the first time,
in all of the four cases below.

## Bula, Beauty & Heft
As a role model, Bula has been able to show people that anything is possible if you work hard and stay determined. She can also bring a calming presence to the home, by demonstrating how to deal with anger and rage in a constructive manner. Rather than letting this energy out in a destructive way, instead use it as a way to build an...

...re Lola’s anger is a catalyst for progress, as it has the potential to very quickly inspire others to take action and create a better world. Lola’s power of getting mad is a beautiful thing, as it allows her to use her anger in a positive way and to create a better future for herself and those that don't come near her.

## Lulu, Sensitive Ears And Love Of Books
Lulu is a superhero who is part raccoon! She loves to use her sensitive ears to listen to narrated books, and she is passionate about using her powers to make the world a better place. Reading books is especially important to raccoon girls like Lulu, as it helps them become better citizens of the world. Books provide them with knowledge, wisdom, and insight that they can use to make positive changes in their lives and the lives of others. They can learn about different cultures, gain empathy, and develop a better understanding of how to help those in need. Through reading books, raccoon girls can become great beings, who can use their powers to make a positive impact in the garbage panda community and the rest of the wold.

## Kiki, The Immortal Warrior
Kiki is an immortal warrior with a long, storied history. Kiki has the elixir of immortality in her veins, which has aging-resistant properties that enable her to live forever. The exact age of Kiki remains unknown, but it is estimated to be at least 20,000 years. Kiki is a protector of the world, ready to defend against its most insidious threats. While normally calm and reserved, she will stop at nothing to bring justice to evil doers. She uses her strength, speed, and near-invincibility to protect the vulnerable and innocent, and her courage and conviction make her an inspiring figure.

As you can see cute product generation this day and age if fun and sweet,
it only takes a little bit of patience, and not being a weenie, especially when it comes to singing.

Please research generative AI, generate some beautiful works of art,
and create a seller account in one of the major commerce platforms that that will take care of printing ans shipping for you.

Both character development and creating $20 posters,
is a lot of fun, it is fun to watch it all develop.

And it sure made,
for a neat afternoon.
