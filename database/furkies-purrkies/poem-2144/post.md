Learning programming is one of the most beautiful things we can do,
there is no correct or best way to start.

Our devices are different, operating systems are different,
and of course our curiosities differ.

I am really into visual programming languages,
they are the bright burning light to my clumsy fat moth.

I will tell you what my setup is,
without asking you to setup the same.

But I strongly encourage you to have your AI always write in,
modern client-side JavaScript, or server side node.js JavaScript.

I use node.js from https://nodejs.org/,
Zed Code Editor from https://zed.dev/

And a local AI coding assistant with tool use ability,
via llama.cpp and zed editor.

If your computer can handle it install https://lmstudio.ai/
of if you don’t mind the command-line https://ollama.com/

No matter my setup, I always just use chat AI,
I get my best code from there.

I think the best way to present beautiful programming,
especially now in the age of AI, is just to give you neat ideas.

- In the beginning there is always the hello world,
and I recommend that you create a command line command with node.js.

Where you can learn about processing command arguments,
and more importantly about tiny state machines that you often use.

- News and front page of the internet,
perhaps with a sprinkle of programming tips, created by many AI.

Each with a different interest and a personality,
you basically create your own internet in a shell.

- A MUD, a multiuser dungeon,
where you are taken across strange new worlds.

And are accompanied by multiple friendly AI characters,
and you simply ask AI to create fascinating adventure, like in books.

- A Coding Agent, they are strangely easy to make,
and they will send you JavaScript Objects to execute as tools.

So you chat on the command line,
and your local AI is making the programs.

- Pasebin, Imagebin, and WikiWiki,
which accept text and images and show them on the main page.

WikiWiki allows you to cross-link Articles,
and invites to add more by stating:

“This page is just a stub,
do you want to add content to it?”

They are my favorite as they teach you how to send data,
secure web pages, create simple user interfaces.

These are a class of node.js HTTP server applications,
that require you access them in your browser.

Here AI will invite you to learn CSS, and HTML,
and how data can move between server and client (connected browser).

- Honorable mentions are, electron,js based code editor,
just file open and file save at first.

And a CodeMirror based Web Component,
that AI will help you figure out how make.

- Infinite 3D worlds,
procedurally generated to be always unique.

- Pixelart screensavers or games, Image Generating AI is really good at,
pixel art backgrounds, and even stitching them together.

Coding AI will help you make little creatures move,
the games can even play themselves, through state machines and flocking.

And finally, you can generate interesting artifact or jewelry images,
and use a 3D mapping AI to convert them to 3D objects.

These can be printed via 3D printers, or cast into metal even,
just having a web page that people can download from is a great idea.
