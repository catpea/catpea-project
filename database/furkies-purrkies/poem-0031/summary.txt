As Good As Fingers
Saturday • April 11th 2020 • 10:49:24 pm

Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Six,

I eat with metal chopsticks.

I stopped using forks,

to munch my porks.

I don't even know how long ago it was,

so long ago, I forgot the cause.

I own two metal chopsticks,

and they work as good as fingers.

I use them to eat my salads,

to scoop out Jelly and Peanut Butter,

I kid you not, I even use them as a little cutter.

A dull stick is just fine to turn a sausage in two.

And of course, I stir many a tea, or protein brew.

I do not miss the dangerous forks,

though once, in a blue moon,

I wish, I owned a spoon.
