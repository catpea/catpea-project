Unfortunately, for most the gym experience starts and ends,
with the Sets and Reps myth, where they only get some result.

They get muscles and burn some fat once,
as they move from couch to the gym, and immediately plateau.

Because lifting heavy means,
they can't lift heavier, and for longer.

It is a fitness tragedy, that so many simply give up,
and hardly ever return to the gym.

Muscle isolation, is a strange thing,
that produces odd results.

Standing dumbbell exercises, with all their twisting and turning,
creates a well balanced musculature with proper posture.

Muscles that grow in natural harmony,
protect the body from injuries.

For one, you never hurt your back,
and if you slip and fall, you can jump right back up.

That is not the case, when you only have islands of muscles,
you have some general fitness, but it isn’t as protective.

An interval timer is is two timers and a countdown of rounds,
the first timer is the workout duration, and second, rest duration.

And the whole point of using a timer is to eliminate rest periods,
so that a workout is non stop, just like jogging.

The moment you don't need to rest,
is the moment you stop using your timer.

While you are on your timer,
consider that a preparation for your workout.

And when you finally full extend your endurance to cover an hour or two,
with a non stop workout, that is your training ends and workout begins.

Interval timers come as an overpriced clip-on versions,
or simply a free app.

And they vibrate, or beep to let you know when to start,
and when to stop.

It is very important to focus on your music during your workout,
as when you lift to every beat, you enter a dance trance.

Similar to a trance you get into,
when driving home from work.

So while an interval timer is a powerful trainer,
it is also a critical focus tool, that works in conjunction with your music.

Same applies to the dumbbells,
as switching between various dumbbell exercises is low distraction.

Focus, is a very important part of your workout,
when it is broken, you get pulled out of your exercise.

The interval timer, the non stop workout, hitting every beat of your song,
the low distraction switching between dumbbell exercises to let muscle groups rest.

All work together to create a powerful workout,
that swiftly and reliably transforms your body, and keep it
flexible and healthy.

This transformative workout is similar to 1980’s aerobics,
except here, you increase intensity whenever you can.

You can switch to faster songs and thus lifting,
move to slightly heavier weights, or add 15 or 30 minutes to your stay at the gym.

And as you can imagine you start with the lightest dumbbells at first,
5lb with occasional switching to 3lb works well, initially.

You should lift light, but no so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy that you have to stop too frequently, or for long.

Every once in a while you may need slower music,
is your new dumbbells weight just feels too heavy.

This will prevent you from stopping too frequently,
and then you can slowly return to faster songs, with powerful results.

---

Finally, now that you know what an integrated workout is like,
and how important focus and flow is.

To configure your interval timer during your initial training phase,
you need to ask two simple questions, to keep your intervals tight.

How long can you lift your current dumbbell weight for,
and how long do you need to rest, to reliably do it again for an hour long workout.

---

You enter the workout and rest times into your timer,
set your rounds so that you have a long an meaningful stay at the gym.

And hit every beat of you current song selection with your current dumbbell weight,
as you cycle between dumbbell exercises to let your muscle groups rest.
