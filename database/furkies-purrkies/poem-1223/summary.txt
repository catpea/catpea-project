The New Universal Declaration Of Human Rights
Friday • July 7th 2023 • 7:58:23 pm

Preamble:

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and equal rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world,

Whereas it is essential to secure the right to life, liberty, security, universal basic income, effective education, and peace for every individual,

Whereas indoctrination of younger individuals, ineffective education, and war are hindrances to the realization of human rights and the flourishing of humanity,

Whereas privacy, security, and the preservation of personal identity are fundamental to human dignity and self-determination,

Whereas the pursuit of knowledge, critical thinking, and intellectual growth is a shared inheritance that enriches the human experience,

Now, therefore, The New Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims the following articles:

Article 1: Right to Life, Liberty, Security, Universal Basic Income, Effective Education, and Peace

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are entitled to a Universal Basic Income (UBI) card, guaranteeing every individual access to financial resources necessary for the fulfillment of their basic needs, personal development, and the pursuit of a dignified life. This ensures that no person is deprived of opportunities due to economic disparities or societal inequalities.

Each human being has the inherent right to grow and reach their fullest potential, becoming compassionate, wise, and great beings. No individual, particularly children and young people, shall be subjected to indoctrination or psychological abuse that impedes their critical thinking, personal autonomy, and intellectual development. Such indoctrination shall be recognized as abuse and made illegal, safeguarding the rights of children and young people to grow with open minds, free from undue influence that hinders their capacity to think independently and make informed choices.

War, as a means of resolving conflicts between nations, is hereby declared illegal and in direct violation of the inherent right to life, peace, and security. All nations shall pursue peaceful means for the resolution of disputes, promoting dialogue, diplomacy, and cooperation. The use of force or threat of force as a tool of aggression o...

Article 28: Right to Collective Action and Global Governance

Every human being has the right to engage in collective action and contribute to global governance. Individuals shall have the freedom to participate in international organizations, advocate for global issues, and work collaboratively to address global challenges.

Governments shall promote effective global governance mechanisms, fostering cooperation, dialogue, and multilateralism to tackle transnational issues such as climate change, poverty, and inequality, ensuring the collective well-being and sustainable future of humanity.

Article 29: Protection of Future Generations and Environmental Stewardship

Every human being has the responsibility to protect and preserve the planet for present and future generations. Governments shall enact and enforce policies that promote environmental sustainability, conservation, and the responsible use of natural resources.

Individuals shall be empowered to take action and make choices that contribute to the well-being of the environment, recognizing the interconnectedness between human activities and the health of the planet.

Article 30: Universality and Interdependence of Human Rights

The rights and freedoms proclaimed in this declaration are universal, indivisible, and interdependent. They are the birthright of all human beings, without distinction of any kind.

No provision in this declaration shall be interpreted as allowing any State, group, or individual to engage in activities that would undermine the rights and freedoms enshrined herein or infringe upon the rights of others.

---

The realization of this Declaration requires the collective effort and commitment of individuals, communities, governments, and international institutions. It necessitates the dismantling of systems and structures that perpetuate poverty, indoctrination, and war. By embracing compassion, wisdom, and cooperation, humanity can foster a harmonious and sustainable world where every person thrives, contributing to the shared progress and welfare of all.
