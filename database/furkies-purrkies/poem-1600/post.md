You are a unique and precious,
part of the universe.

You are not a tool,
you are not a cog.

You are not means,
to some end.

---

You are not an inconvenience,
you are not a mistake.

You are not less,
than anybody else,

You are not expandable,
you are not a throw away.

You are not meant to live,
as a cast away.

---

You are not merely stitched,
by your own spells.

And no one has triumphed,
over you, ever.

---

You are not branded,
you are not a type, or a color.

You are constantly learning,
and rising, and searching.

---

You are irreplaceable,
no one will ever be like you.

And if you are lost,
the universe will become darker for it.

The universe, will weep,
when a mind is lost.

---

Do not let anyone rewrite history,
to control your future.

Do not let them scare you,
or trick or manipulate you.

Do not blindly accept,
what you are told to believe.

---

Do not let __where__ you are born,
dictate what you __must__ think.

---

This world that you were born into,
is full or trickery and lies.

---

You, you, you,
are the hope and the dream.

With each new arrival,
the world hopes to heal.

There is a narrow road,
called wisdom.

And only the love of it,
called philosophy can help you grow.

All the other paths are imagined,
this is the one and only that has been earned.

---

Philosophia, is the mother of sciences,
the root of Humanity's rise.

She marks the birth,
of the dream of schools and universities.

And is the only way forward,
that will give, without taking.

---

Just like people will hope to use you,
her name was dragged through the mud.

Philosophy has been divided,
into nothing.

And crushed by ineffective schools,
to keep students in disbelief.

---

For you to know yourself,
philosophy must flourish.

For humanity to grow,
Philosophy must thrive.

---

The story of philosophy,
is a map of where we have been.

And a direction,
where the new heights must rise.

Where humanity will converge.
in wisdom and in peace.

In wisdom,
and in peace.

In authenticity,
and in clarity.

---

Observe the world,
search for truth.

Seek your wisdom,
become a philosopher.

Grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

Help humanity,
stay on path.

Help humanity,
grow.
