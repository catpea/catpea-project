I took another look at the lulz language,
noted several problems and had AI fix them all creating a v2.0.

Lulz has its roots in ffmpeg filtergraph language,
except it uses JavaScript array notation.

What is really unusual here is that input an output of a function,
is marked by strings, ‘in’ and ‘out’, for example.

The sting ‘out’ causes the creation of a data pipe, named out,
and sting ‘in’ is a reference to an existing pipe created elsewhere.

This created an unusual effect, where this strange idea,
is somewhat frighteningly readable as the [AGENTS.md][2] file shows.

(The AGENTS.md file is meant for AI instructions,
but I made it into a readable manifesto)

---

I kept my original [Chicken Scratch][1],
where I thought up the JavaScript array notation.

It if of some note that, incomplete JavaScript,
is more than enough to trigger the generation of a program.

AI aside, there may not be a greater invitation to programming,
you don’t need to finish your grunt work, just let AI do it.

---

I inverted the program, it is no longer parallel execution first,
though it is just a matter of square brackets.

I also added two functions, parallel and series,
to eliminate any need for memorization of square brackets.

And true to the parallel processing mission,
I added [worker integration and friendly documentation][3].

Worker integration is what justifies this write up alone,
it is [frighteningly powerful][4].

This is parallel processing like, but it is wisely distributed,
and [I asked AI to carefully explain code and patterns][5]

From this second look at lulz, this is just about good enough,
to make every node.js programmer pause for a moment.

The code readability is shocking,
and and parallel processing with readable code is precious.

---

In closing,
Visual Programming is the next generation of code.

But it can’t be visual,
because graphic user interfaces are too noisy.

So a textual representation of Visual Programming is necessary,
and it turned out, that is just two strings around a funcion.

// Example
‘user-signup’, saveUserToDatabase, ‘user-added’,

user-signup is the output end of some other command,
and user-added is a pipe where info about users added spews out from.

And many other commands can now use,
user-added as their input pipe.

This is visual programming,
but reduced to two strings of letters.

With a visual programming implementation behind us,
we can now do all the next generation things.

Like enjoying clear to comprehend parallel processing patterns,
and collaborating with AI agents on tiny well defined functions.

As opposed to large code based that AI refers to as lies,
and can only best-guess and then test via human made tests.

On a personal note, it makes no sense not to use lulz,
for all of my projects.

And from a broader perspective, I think the success of this project,
is proof, that nobody knows how to use AI yet, we only scratched the surface.

(And if that want enough,
the language has a pretty cute mascot)
