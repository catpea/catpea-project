Gyms are for fit people for when it is too cold, or too hot,
or life gets too busy and they have to compress hours into minutes.

That people made a business out allowing anybody in,
does not mean that what you see at the gym, is evidence that it works.

People who will argue this, are actually stuck on a plateau,
having only developed muscles once, that first time they tried hard.

For the rest of us, gyms are where our hopes of transforming our bodies, die,
because the machines are too awkward, the crowd to distracting.

And we are so far behind, that a beautiful and fit person,
just remind us how many times we tried and failed.

An employee of a gym, can only give you gym advice,
or they will get fired.

They will only encourage you to do it wrong,
and as a result you’ll only ever work out twice or thrice.

The people who have some muscle but got stuck on a plateau,
reveal the problem with the gym.

They started in the middle, with already heavy weights,
and went heavier, too heavy too short, for their bodies to continue to adapt.

There is not enough room to get started, and eveyone becomes misguided,
the machines are not for people who are not fit, and they do little for those who are.

And just working on a couple of muscles at a time while sitting down,
would take many decades to transform a large person, anyway.

A gym is not useless, so as long as you know how to use it,
you need real workout experience.

That you can then take to a gym and compress, and distill,
and optimize, and itemize.

Lacking that real workout experience, most people will lift so heavy,
that they only cut their circulation off.

While thinking, that they have reached the magical muscle failure point,
and now their muscles cannot help to grow as they heal – but that is not true.

The real truth is found in bicyclist, jogger, cross country runner, swimmer,
or ultra-marathon runner musculature.

For those people duration comes first, long before they touch any weights,
they increase their endurance.

To at the very least have a non stop one hour long workout,
it is the duration that communicates to our body that change is needed.

If you are older and large, you do not start at the gym,
because the gym will end you.

You start by learning to walk for an hour without stopping,
if it is in you, walk for two.

And as soon as you can,
begin walking with dumbbells In your hands.

And as you already know deep down,
you work out for no less than 5 days a week.

I am not asking you to jog,
I an not asking you to begin by walking for an hour.

I am asking you to take baby steps,
to stop as much as you need, and to write down, how long you rest for.

You will need a stop watch,
and you will need to focus on eliminating those rest periods.

To stay at it, walk to the beats of slow songs,
or listen to narrated books keeping a good pace.

---

We are walking machines,
that is your first exercise.

You will transform your body, by never sitting,
by giving your body months of time to adapt to heavier weights.

And by understanding, that endurance is your superpower,
and like hikers on the Appalachian Trail, you can walk 20 miles a day.

And then, once you see that you have reached the maximum,
of what your body can handle, you come to the gym.

Where you will find controlled climate
treadmills and machines.

For when you are hurt,
but still haven’t finished your minimum five workouts.

And where you can find your dumbbells,
and a square of space, where you can re-create an optimized version of walking.

Now with the ability to lift above your head,
without the fear of falling.

Where you don’t need multiple layers of clothing,
that can only get wet.

And where, at the very least you can find a fan
and a cold drink, when you get too overheated.

---

If you are young, you are overestimating how many chances you have,
at becoming fit and muscular.

Crappy people, stress, job, overeating, bills, poverty, and even parents,
will push you away from gaining endurance and achieving stable fitness.

You should not be at the gym at all, you need to walk the triple crown,
The Appalachian, Pacific Crest Trail and Continental Divide trails.

And begin training to run multiple consecutive marathons,
as an Ultra (an Ultramarathonrunner)

If you have aged, then know this,
there is nothing more terrifying than an older woman fighting for life.

There is nothing more glorious,
then taking three hours of walking and converting it into an hour of wild animal rage.

And if a trainer with a straight face or a smile,
ever tells you to sit, lay, or calm down.

Polighty inqure when was the last time,
that they had a solid - life changing - ass whopi`n.

Because, not only is resting diring excercise a terrible idea,
it is also a sure path to an early grave - and you know, I am correct.

Once you complete your endurance training, there is no rest during a workout,
and duration always comes, before the damn weights.

You must learn to walk the walk,
and only then by, subtle analogy.

Will you know the truth from the myths,
and lift and live, long.
