Dancing is very smart,
and it is ancient warrior art.

There is no better way to lose weight
than dance really great.

To really get fit,
you must really-really do it.

---

It really is true,
that no matter what you do...

You cannot outrun a doughnut,
but, but, but!

...you __can__ out dance the damn thing,
and look really great by next Spring.

---

You once... had a choice to make,
either be serious or eat cake.

Now, time has come to pay,
and thus you must River Dance every day.

---

Your reputation will alter,
but you must never falter.

Your health is a big deal,
and you must dance with great zeal.

---

So as long as you dance,
you will advance.

To transform into an athlete.
all you have to do is hit every beat.

---

Get serious about dancing,
be serious about prancing.

---

Even if you are the only one in your city,
dance, dance to look pretty.

Go out jogging, and when you stop,
dance and hop.

There is no better way,
dance, dance, every day.
