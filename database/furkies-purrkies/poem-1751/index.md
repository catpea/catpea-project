Schools are humanity’s greatest idea,
and when done right the simplest thing in the world.

Real schools just require individualized instruction,
and honoring talent, curiosity and pace of learning.

They also have to pay the student,
so that no child can ever be controlled by thereat of poverty.

Fear and stress, disables learning,
because real education is about comfort.

When you get to choose what to learn next,
you are just having fun, all the time.

You don’t want to leave school,
you have projects that you care about there.

You may need to stay late to finish some programming thing,
or wait for you 3D print to finish.

Or even just sit there watching your CNC machine,
cutting out your fancy new wallet.

---

You see, programming, 3D printing, and CNC machining,
all involve mathematics is a super interesting way.

In programming you will WANT TO learn how to,
how to programmatically create 3D objects.

Manual modeling a wallet or some precision device,
will seem silly, as you peck at the vertices.

Boolean geometry is so easy, that you won’t be able to stop,
merging and subtracting shapes to create precision stuff.

Generative jewelry, knives, and 2D cutouts,
that people can screw together with little screws to create huge robots.

When you have a reason to learn math,
you just navigate the good parts, yo love it.

You don’t want to leave a real school,
just to sleep in your bed.

And there are no grades, because every one of your discoveries,
is perfect, and infinitely precious to you.

---

The schools we have today are unfinished,
and people use that to make a profit.

You can’t really learn math,
by going to math class.

You can love mathematical machines,
and when you love enough of them you become better.

At whatever it is that entices you,
to need all those math machines or programs.

The truth is, that a class labeled as Math,
that forces dumb story problems at you…

Is [a crime][1], a [betrayal, an insult][2], even an attack,
[because it destroys your creativity][3].

---

You’ve been betrayed by people who didn’t know any better.
precisely because their education was ineffective.

And unless you start learning for real,
and inherit your intellectual inheritance from thousands of narrated books.

You too will be blind to what is eating the word,
and you too will betray.

You can’t let fake school get in the way of your real education,
as that is how graduation will make a fool out of you.

You have to find what interest you, it will be about 10 things,
and start the cycle, where you hop from one to anther.

Enhancing all as you learn from each,
you have to saturate a subject, switch to something that will bring relief.

And carry on, until you are ready to return to where you left off,
one by one, revisiting each of your curiosities.

New ones will come, conquered will fade,
and in return you will rise, not just aging but growing up.

Do not let the men who sold the world win,
do not let the manipulators and opportunists stress you into a worker.

Rise, and rise again,
until you [become a great being][4].
