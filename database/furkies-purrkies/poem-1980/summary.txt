Holy Guacamole: Learn JavaScript Today!
Saturday • August 2nd 2025 • 10:19:43 pm

Everyone continues learning what AI can do,
what is going on is that AI gives you massive superpowers.

All you need to do is watch a few tutorials,
maybe install [electron-fiddle][1].

And start asking AI what do you need to do to add this,
and that.

Tell it to use Bootstrap Utility API only,
to get rid of all the CSS style fluff.

The first step is easy, because you aren’t doing much,
and you just ask AI.

The second step is easy,
because you ask AI not for applications you want.

But applications it can make beautifully,
simple, elegant and lightweight.

You can be publishing an app or two,
in some app-store in a week or a month.

---

But the third step,
is just wild.

Because when you get into programming,
you instantly become superhuman super powerful.

Allow me to show you,
[what that looks like][2].

I faced an annoying problem this morning,
roughly speaking, when I was parsing code.

I didn’t know if I was outside brackets,
inside brackets, or quotes within brackets.

[The AI knew about the dilemma very well][0],
and even insulted a leading company for not doing it right.

There are 5 solutions to the problem,
AI encouraged me to use the simplest.

I asked for all five,
and [in a singe afternoon, I did three years of programming][3].

I maybe a slowpoke,
so any novice can do the same.

---

I don’t want to bore you with code details,
but in closing will read to you the incredibly sounding description.

Of each item, just to show you how incredible programming with AI is,
how it will help you every step of the way.

What I want you to understand, is that the bigger the problem,
the better AI is at solving it for you, even in multiple ways.

AI is your private personal code savant,
the doors to the incredible world of programming are wide open to you.

1. [The State-machine strategy][state-machine] gives you a solid foundation for the XMLParser to process the markers and convert them into reactive DOM updates!

2. [The Quote and Bracket approach][quote-bracket] is ideal when you need **absolute accuracy** and **comprehensive context information**, especially for complex templates with mixed quote types and escaped sequences!

3. [Regular Expression strategy][regex-based] gives you excellent performance for the 90% case while still being robust enough for production use!

4. [Token based strategy][token-based] approach gives you the best balance of accuracy and maintainability, making it ideal for production template systems where correctness is paramount!

5. [Multi-pass strategy][multi-pass] is the most sophisticated approach that provides maximum accuracy through systematic verification. This multi-pass strategy represents the **gold standard** for template parsing - when you absolutely need to get the context right every time, regardless of template complexity!
