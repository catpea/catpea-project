Nobody is purrfect and I wear a tail to the gym,
especially on Halloween.

It occurred to me that our distant ancestors used to have one,
and I try to have some extra fun.

I aim to figure out what our tails were for,
by hopping and dancing on my gym floor.

My tail is very strong,
and about 30 inches long.

So I’ve been learning to move it about,
and I made progress, without a doubt.

I can swing left and right, make little loops,
and even large jumping hops.

Some day, spelling my name,
may become my clam to fame.

At the moment, I am refining my wagging,
and my progress is not lagging.

Just this afternoon I’ve noticed a thing,
when I danced a little swing.

So, I have so advice to share,
good for those who move like a square.

A tail is great for practicing dance,
as it helps the hips advance.

Every instructor should have a box of tails,
as that will teach even the slowpoke snails.

It is easy to explain how to move hips,
when you instruct your students to make tails whips.

They won’t try to move their whole mid section,
to keep the tail in action.

They will aim to rhythmically snap their hips,
even naturally adding dips.

So as long as they keep the tail moving,
they will be improvising and improving.

Get them to raise their hands to mid height,
and move from left to right.

And their hips and tail will soon follow to swing,
with a marvelous and fluid zing.

If you help them tip and lift one leg a bit,
their footwork will even become a hit.

Teaching the novice to dance,
should not be about moves or stance.

As that will be boring,
at a time when they are still exploring.

A tail is a new thing,
that will instantly teach their hips to swing.

And if they want to keep it up,
they have to stay in sync just like that.

It is a joy to wag,
they’ll stay with the beat without a snag.

They’ll sync up and move without a quirk,
even improvising their footwork.

All for their fancy large tail,
all hip dancing without a fail.

I always say, that if you got a tail bone,
then your tail is not gone.

Our hips are still tail-wise,
and they need good exercise.

So give the hips a chance,
and do a little tail dance.
