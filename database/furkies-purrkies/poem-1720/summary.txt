Bodybuilding For Golden Ladies
Saturday • November 16th 2024 • 1:08:12 am

I write this at the end of the week that saw the public release of [AlphaFold 3][1],
an intelligent program for understanding Proteins, previously a difficult task.

And [Evo][2], a program for modeling DNA, all the way down from it nucleotides,
the units of DNA, it can understand existing and create new DNA.

And an announcement of a skin repair booster, that reverses some of the effects of aging,
the paper is titled “[Human skin rejuvenation via mRNA][3]”

Currently bodybuilding is our first and best formula,
that will keep us young.

Some of the bodybuilders that you admire,
are not only older than you, but more fit than teenagers.

[Ernestine Shepard who is 88 years young at the time of writing][4],
started bodybuilding at 55, and I bet she did not have all the answers.

Above all, bodybuilding is special,
because when done simply your body continues on growing muscle.

Other sports like jogging, are too high impact, too fast,
bodybuilding is just about dancing with dumbbells.

And the wise bodybuilder, starts with two pound dumbbells,
and then your body will tell you when you can move on up to 4.

I created a very simple workout rule and goes like this:
Not so light that you can add more weight, but not so heavy that you are forced to stop.

But before you get to lifting your 2 pound dumbbells,
per hand.

You have to train yourself, to walk long distances,
sometimes at the gym, but on nice days, out in nature.

We are all mighty walkers,
we are built for it.

And it is walking that begins restoring out body,
your cartilage will regrow, so as long as your body needs it.

All the medication, all the doctor advice,
has been handed to you under the assumption of you slowing down.

As you become a walker, your will hear a different story,
a story of your joints easy regrowing, of needing less medication.

You are switching from a sedimentary lifestyle,
to an active one, you are transforming.

I begun my transformation by walking to my local supermarket,
and at first, I would reward myself with wonders like Ice Cream.

The next step, is to get some wrist weights, and leg weights,
and add protein to your diet, including peanut butter for energy.

As you move more, you will need more calories,
and you’’l find all you need in peanut butter an jelly, maybe eggs and vegetable juice.

You got to keep on speeding up,
synchronizing your steps with faster and faster music.

An act which puts you in a blissful trance,
that makes hours pass – narrated books are great too.

And finally, once you gain the ability to walk with two pound dumbbells,
for a long non stop hour, you then walk into your gym.

And start dancing, like with your walking,
you will be making tiny dance moves at first.

It will be hard to lift dumbbells above your head,
and work your biceps, or lift with your arms to the side for an hour.

But dancing, is an improvement over walking with dumbbells,
you can work on your upper body without worrying about what is beneath your feet.

Unlike walking, dancing asks you to twist and turn,
so you extend the range of motion you earned walking.

And from here you only twist more, dance to faster music,
add ten minutes to your daily workout whenever you can.

And follow my little rule when it comes to the weight of your dumbells:
“Not so light that you can add more weight, but not so heavy that you are forced to stop”
