I've been making web pages for ages,

learning slowly in many stages.

I begun in 1999,

and I am still learning new things about design.

All the programming languages changed many times,

but knowing the whole history is very useful at times.

I've learned a lot from the command line,

to art, colors, design, and how to reach the finish line.

I am surprised how long it all took,

but with all I know I am sure I could write a whole book.

I still have to learn a bunch of stuff,

but it is not going to be very tough.

I mostly have to get all the colors, and glows to dance and blend,

I kind of left all the fun stuff for the very end.
