I have spent another couple of days with advanced programming AI,
I keep going over my usage quota.

I pay $20 per month
and this is almost fair for experimentation.

When you are ready to build a project,
and can see the money, you will need to switch to $100 per months.

Though probably just for a month or two,
as you tidy up and publish.

I created multiple applications, without writing any code,
but the AI does not always see mistakes, so you need to debug.

Debugging is detective work, it is a game,
it is not architecting frameworks and writing complex code, AI does that.

---

AI does not create spaghetti code,
though I always tell it to follow Mozilla Developer Network conventions.

Not to use frameworks,
not to use external libraries.

---

Your instincts should be telling you, that because everyone has access to AI,
does not that create a fierce competition, and an equal playground again.

No, because AI multiplies you and your abilities,
you were small before getting lost in noise and complexity.

But now, AI makes you the size of an efficient company,
and you idea constantly drills down into undiscovered territory.

The AI will program anything you want it too,
of any level of complexity, you will be constantly innovating.

Your product will be as unique as you are,
its creation is no longer limited by your abilities.

It is now fueled by your uniqueness, your personality,
and by how you see programming and the world.

---

Lets say you have always been a mere participant,
all you really have is an app you like.

That makes you a programmer now,
AI enables you to move from observer to creator.

---

You can use electron-fiddle for desktop application,
or like me github pages for client side, web applications.

Jus those two things, get you started,
you just ask AI what this gibberish even is.

---

To give you an example of the debugging you have to do,
my program automatically slices AI generated grids of UI components.

A human would require three days of maddening selecting and cropping,
and would in fact quit, it is not reasonable to do this by hand.

My program detects where the grid is, slices everything up,
detects background, removes it cleanly.

And I choose if a graphic motif is a button, or a border,
the AI forgot to save the border coordinates.

It is an obvious bug, you see it instantly,
once you tell the AI about it, it goes crazy fixing everything.

If you make a mistake, and the bug is somewhere else,
the AI will keep tiding up the area that you think a bug is in.

It will keep saying I tidied this up, I tidied that up,
I added debug statements…

At which point, you will realize,
it does not see a but, and search harder on your end.

---

There is no AI bubble, but thinking machines,
change everything, and the world will undergo a change.

The bubblers spreading the bubble propaganda,
are just trying to delay the inevitable.

Start learning how to talk to AI,
and how to talk about web application.

And build what you like, so deep, or high up,
that your program will be irresistible to those who you set free from grunt work.

---

Finally, my biggest lesson this week,
was that AI can write complex code.

Code that only corporations and scientists were capable of,
think bigger than big, and ask for a lightweight or minimalist version of it.

You are more powerful,
than you can imagine.

Such is the age,
of thinking machines.
