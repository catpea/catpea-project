In a clown world where anybody can say;
“Philosophers are villains”.

And have countess numbers of people agree,
because although they have never read their books...

Most of the philosophers they’ve seen,
had crazy hair and unhappy expressions.

---

Many things are flipped backwards,
Philosophers were actually protecting us from villains.

Philosophers are programmers, they will say “god created numbers”,
and then, that god is not actually real.

And you have to run their programs, decode what they said,
against who they were, and what they were forced to be.
