Back when I was a Teenager,

one late Friday afternoon.

I had a nap, so amazing,

I have never forgotten about it.

I woke up light as a feather,

and I dressed beautifully.

And went exploring,

little Coffee Shops in Plymouth.

I went to see The Brew Ha Ha,

full of Mighty Minds with Extreme Dreams.

I peeked into Coffee Studio,

and saw Angel-headed Hipsters reading Tolstoy.

I poked into The Bean,

full of Dirty Hippies, reciting Beautiful Poetry.

I made my way back home,

walking alone through streets of gold.

I read Chaucer,

programmed Visual Basic.

And went back to sleep,

full of new memories that I would keep.
