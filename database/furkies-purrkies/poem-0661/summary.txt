Eleven Philosophers And A List Of Great Beings - An Accelerated Learning Course And A Memory Palace
Tuesday • December 21st 2021 • 7:02:39 pm

This course is based on the pricey "[The Giants of Philosophy](https://www.audible.com/series/The-Giants-of-Philosophy-Audiobooks/B08D6T4RDC)" series of 12 audio books,\
I selected it because it is well written by competent writers, and read by Charlton Heston.

This is a beginning, and what better start,\
then the most powerful and famous Philosophers.

I will alert you to the fact that there is in deed something missing here,\
you are not witnessing the culture of greatness.

For this I have prepared a List of Great Beings at the end of this text,\
and I leave it up to you to locate their videos.

---

Let us,\
begin.

---

A Philosopher is a human being who has already connected with you,\
they thought about you, about all of us.

We are for most of them,\
the future generations.

For all their greatness, mistakes, regrets, disasters, tortures, and horrors,\
they loved us, and they believed in us.

And they knew that as we grow,\
we would set aside their mistakes and focus on their best.

So that we may begin,\
where their greatness leaves off.

---

Before you pick up one of their books,\
their means of communicating with you.

Take to their summaries, overviews, critique,\
take to books that talk about their books.

And before you consider buying a guide book,\
even before you consider watching a video.

There is something you must do,\
you have to befriend them, and without a question they will befriend you.

To become friends with a Philosopher,\
you have to invite them into your home sometimes across hundreds of years of time.

---

I am about to tell you how to do that,\
get ready.
