Of course, there is the right way and the wrong way,
if you just do sets, reps, and rest, you are not going to be buff any time soon.

But if you start with aerobics, build up your endurance,
for an hour long non-stop workout, similar to how joggers eliminate stopping.

And then add 2 pound dumbbells, just grab onto them and dance,
again building up your endurance for a full hour non-stop.

You will be entering the big muscle zone,
you may not even need to past 6lb per hand.

What people don’t understand,
is that the speed of your dance music and weight of your dumbells.

Bare a kind of a strange equivalence, if you speed up your music,
instead of adding more weight, you will see muscle growth.

Your body does not adapt to the weight of dumbbells,
but the challenge those dumbbells pose - the impact they have on your body.

Unlike muscle isolation, or machines you sit on,
dumbbells are a full body workout.

There is a very precise meaning to that,
full body means, you get the muscles of a swimmer, an athlete.

Muscle isolation, if done correctly for an hour,
just gives you the muscles you isolated,

And because you are doing one muscle at a time, it is slow,
and wham done incorrectly it takes 15 years.

Sets and reps are just a myth, not only is it slow,
it is 90% sitting around.

But dancing with dumbbells,
upgrades your entire musculature.

Which in turn makes you more capable at moving with dumbbells,
which makes you adapt faster, and grow larger.

Aerobic workout, as you might have seen in videos from the 80s,
basically dancing with dumbbells, only tone your body.

Until you start moving to heavier dumbbells,
if you move by increments of 2 or 2.5 pounds, you slow but never stop.

As to how serious you should take this warning,
that depends how serious you are as a person.

What I can tall you is that bodybuilding is not about the looks,
but about your health.

If you are large, then most of your bodybuilding is already done,
wearing body fat, is the same as wearing a weighted body vest.

But fat is no good for our organs, range of motion, for our back,
so you get rid of that with dancing.

But you still need light dumbbells, to preserve your muscles,
medication and hard fasting consumes both fat and muscle, and that is a shame.

If you are skinny, muscles are like an injury dampener,
they protect you from injury.

I fell down a full flight of stairs some two years ago,
and instead of getting all broken up.

I ended up bouncing on every stair like a magnificent sausage,
I was back at the gym the next day.

So muscles are like armor, a kind of a exo skeleton maybe,
and if you can stay with maybe 5 pounds dumbbells, it wont be noticeable.

Just as important as a well balanced dance physique,
is the fact that you are moving, helping your body thrive.

Large or Skinny, workouts make you tired, and that is because,
they use up your energy reserves – a skinny person just gets there faster.

To fix that up in a jiffy, you need either trailmix, which is tough on your teeth,
or peanut butter and jelly; in both cases add eggs and protein.

So as long as it is stuff that is hard to digest, your body will continue using it,
before exercise, during excessive, after, and even while you sleep.

Your tiredness is a result of a mistake,
just like stopping to rest during a workout is a result of a mistake.

You fix the fix by eating hard to digest food that stays with you,
and the second, by scaling down your weights, until you don’t have to stop.

I came up with a short saying: “Not so light that you can add more weight,
but not so heavy that you are forced to stop.”

If people knew how easy it is to dance non-stop,
with progressively heavier dumbbells.

Especially, since you enter a time warping dance-trance from the music,
all the large people would become muscular just the same year.

I think that would be a scary world,
certainly intimidating.
