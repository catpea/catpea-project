Hard running is the worst thing you can do,
and it is the best thing you can do.

Hard running is concrete, city, snow,
it is rain, mud, pain, scrapes and bruises.

Hard running,
is running for the rest of us.

At first walking, almost-jogging, jogging and running,
a way to awaken our body.

Gradually, and with long rest periods at first,
and then none, as we slowly cut them shorter and shorter.

Hard running, is dumbbells,
narrated books and songs synchronized to out step.

A way to breathe new life into our old body,
simply by extending its endurance.

Alcohol, Drugs, Cigarettes, TV, Religion,
Sugar, Bread, Soft-drinks, an other crud…

Is a way to deal with discomfort,
so whatever is causing your discomfort, needs to go first.

Do you have a crappy job,
are you around the wrong people, you need to shrug, and go.

---

You have one life, and the elder you,
on their last day, must have no regrets.

They must especially not regret,
dying early, from stress, obesity, or addiction, or simply for nothing.

Your life is everything,
every day is precious.

---

If you feel you have been missing something,
that is greatness, greatness of heart and mind.

Always listen to books written by clear thinking,
non religious intellectuals, they will help you to their knowledge and culture.

They will help you grow all the way up,
until you too become a great being.

You begin by walking, right now,
especially if you are already in bed, though 2AM is best.

Make a long circle around your neighborhood... carve your trail,
before you now it, this will be your jogging route.

If you live in a bad neighborhood,
you move, you will break contracts, to live.

You will soon break skin,
you are to walk with dumbbells in hand, you will trip.

Hopefully the plates,
are larger than your fists, and will protect you.

Your knees will hurt,
but that is what need do.

You know knuckle tattoos that say Love on one hand,
and hate on the other.

The equivalent knee tattoos,
simply say, pain, and $%&*( pain.

Have your doctor take a look,
but you are walking to protect your knees.

Jogging on concrete is a bad idea...
perhaps even if you are not heavy.

But pain in general, is precious,
it gives you a tiny boost of energy.

If you have no injury,
just pain, then you are in luck.

---

Rain will come, get rain proof clothing,
cover your face if you must.

Walking in rain is interesting,
jogging is all right, just don’t stop.

Rain will cool your body down,
that may just be the greatest source of energy.

Eventually as your workouts become regular,\
you might want to sign-up for gym.

Gym gives you climate control,
but, it is very boring, and you will have to dance with dumbells.

---

You will discover, that it is impossible to run when it is snowing,
because the snowflakes get in your eyes.

So as Autumn comes to a close,
get yourself some discount skiing goggles.

Be careful not to slip,
go jogging at the gym when it gets too icy.

Cold wind is also huge trouble,
so get a nice fleece ski mask.

Dress as necessary,
walking and then jogging is your new life.

---

You will get blisters,
but that just happens in the beginning.

You may be able to avoid the worst of it,
if you wear thick socks.

Trim your claws or you are going to lose them,
if you do, always have an ingrown toenail kit in your first aid pocket.

It is called field repair,
you will need superglue, duck tape, and sunblock.

---

Hard running is hard,
you will lose everything, but double your lifespan.

You will have a second chance,
this time as a bodybuilder.

---

Dumbbells are to never leave your hands,
they will affect your entire musculature.

Dumbbells, are better than vitamins,
and they are not dumb at all.

---

Hard running has one rule,
when presented with a choice, you choose the harder one.

You never wait for rain to pass,
though in great part, because, once you do, it never will.

---

Hard running,
is going to be the hardest thing you’ve ever done.

It will take you to the Appalachian Trail, to the Pacific Crest Trail,
to the Continental Divide.

It will take you to every library you can find,
in search for books that will help you heal.

Hard running will make you alone,
but people will never think you are a freak.

The car that passed by screaming,
was not flipping you off, they were celebrating you.

The person that tried to say something,
was actually trying to tell you that you are an inspiration.

You will become a force of goodness,
and your narrated books will bring you great wisdom.

Always choose the harder,
especially the harder right, over the easier wrong.
