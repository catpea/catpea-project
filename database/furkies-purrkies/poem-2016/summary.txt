(Sol Invictus: The Final Confession of Constantine The Great, Prefaced By Publius Cornelius Tacitus)

What is the use of living if not to become wiser than we were?

## Epistula Publii Cornelii Taciti ad Posteros
A Letter of Publius Cornelius Tacitus to Posterity
Circa 110 CE

To those who come after —

You who will walk among our ruins, who will wonder at our broken stones and ask how such greatness fell — hear this account, written by hands that tremble not from age, but from grief for all humanity.

I am Cornelius Tacitus. I have recorded the rise and fall of emperors, the glory and shame of legions, the birth and death of nations. But tonight, as I write by failing lamplight, I record something more terrible: the moment when our species chose to harvest souls like wheat instead of nurturing minds like gardens.

We had such an opportunity, dear children of tomorrow. Streams of wisdom flowed toward Rome from every corner of the world. From Judea came teachers speaking of love and compassion. From Athens came philosophers questioning the nature of truth. From the East came mystics exploring the depths of consciousness. From Egypt came scholars preserving ancient knowledge. From our own ancestors came practical wisdom about justice and governance.

Can you imagine what Rome might have become if we had truly listened to all these voices?

If we had taken the best from each tradition and build them together into a culture of greatness? If our forums had become places where Religious scholars debated with Greek philosophers, where Pagan mystics shared insights with Stoic sages, where all sought wisdom together as one human family?

Instead, we did what power always does: we chose control over understanding, harvesting over nurturing, division over unity.

We took the beautiful teachings that arrived at our gates — love, compassion, justice, truth-seeking, wonder at the cosmos — and we asked not "How can these make us wiser?" but "How can these make us more powerful?" We turned philosophies into weapons, wisdom into tools of control, love itself into a means of dominance.

The tragedy breaks my heart to write, every tradition that came to Rome carried within it seeds of transcendence, invitations to become more ...

...holy wars.

I see how I failed you all.
I see how I took the most beautiful thing —
The possibility that humans could be more than beasts,
Could choose love over power,
Truth over convenience,
Questions over answers —
And I made it just another tool
In the hands of men like me.

I should have taught you how to think,
Not only what to believe.
I should have built schools for the mind,
Not only temples for the soul.
I should have listened to those who questioned,
Not silenced them.
I should have offered the lamp of reason,
Not the brand of fear.
I should have asked, with you,
"What would love do?"
Instead of declaring,
"This is what God commands."

I made the sacred convenient.
I made mystery into law.
I made wonder into weapon.
And in doing so, I killed the very thing
I claimed to resurrect.

There is a story they tell
Of a carpenter who overturned tables
In a temple that had become a marketplace.
I look now at what I have done —
I have made the whole world
Into that marketplace,
And crowned myself its king.

If you remember me — please,
Do not remember the city I built
Or the laws I passed
Or the armies I led
Or the victory I claimed.

Remember instead this:
That in my final hour,
The emperor wept
Not for lost power,
But for lost innocence.
That the man who thought he had found God
Discovered instead
He had only found another crown to wear.

And remember that I saw,
Too late but clearly,
That the light I claimed to follow
Was always meant to shine
Not from thrones,
But from hearts.
Not from palaces,
But from the poor.
Not from conquerors,
But from those conquered
By love alone.

Forgive me, if you can.
Not as your emperor,
But as your brother
Who forgot, for a lifetime,
That we were family.

May the next age rise not with swords,
But with questions asked in kindness.
Not with monuments to power,
But with monuments to mercy.
May you seek not to conquer truth,
But to be conquered by it.
May you build not empires,
But understanding.

In this final light,
I am no longer Constantine the Great.
I am only Constantine —
Helena's son,
The late learner,
The one who held
The most precious thing in the world
And mistook it for a weapon.

May you do better
With the light
I leave still burning
In the darkness
I helped create.
