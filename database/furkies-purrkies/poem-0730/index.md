Learning life is of utmost weight,\
we must all learn to navigate.

You can do it in real life:\
by means of strife.

Or in the world of art,\
by **slowly** rising to become smart.

---

No one will tell you this,\
but life-advice is hit and miss.

And life is far to dear,\
to play it by ear.

Don't just take any advice,\
for that always comes at a price.

---

Listen to great beings only,\
and you will never become lost **or** lonely.

**They** are the ones that know,\
for they are the ones that grow.

---

And no one will tell you **this**,\
life is meant for sweet bliss.

You are not meant to trade your talents,\
for paychecks and life-and-work balance.

Your talents must grow,\
as they will teach you a lot of what you must to know.

And all else must come from great beings,\
that's how you get at your true beginnings.

---

Both life and art are an ocean,\
this is a very important notion.

To multiply your growth,\
navigate one and master both both.
