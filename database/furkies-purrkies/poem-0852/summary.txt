,
as it is simple and it comes with a neat tutorial.

or stand over you.

you begin remembering that you are smart.

Schools trick us into thinking,
that we are only as good as our grades.

And programming can remind us,
we are just as good as aaaall the smart people.

The tutorials,
show what real education is like.

The speed at which you learn,
is influenced by what you know.

The more you know,

But it is not good,
because you have to dream.

You have to dream everything up,

and Svelte shows you everything step by step.

Especially when they show you a reactive button,
in section 2, under Reactivity / Assignments.

It wouldn't be too hard to explain math this way,
, everything is always moving.

and you should get angry.

Teachers preoccupied you with trivial math,

Here, all the boring calculations are done for you,
and you day dream in radians of the unit circle.

First you reinvent vectors,
so that you paint, what you wan to paint.

And then when you get tired of painting,
you reinvent magnets or .

and even better, there is no limit to how far you can take programming.
