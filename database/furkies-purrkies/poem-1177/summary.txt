Of The Dance Around The Constellation Of Your Curiosities
Monday • May 22nd 2023 • 10:49:15 pm

Focus on learning things that you care about, it is really not possible,
to learn about things that you don’t care about.

Oh, we can memorize,
but if we can’t conceptualize or revolutionize, it is just a parlor trick.

You are powerful, your mind is a force of nature,
don’t waste it on pretending to know something by memorization.

When you are predisposed,
to master the constellation of curiosities within you.

Memorization is shallow,
there is little there.

And curiosity is boundless,
a source of genius, brilliance, and success.

Please understand,
that your mind will reject what isn’t personally interesting to you.

It will always,
be an uphill battle.

On the other end, your mind will inhale,
whatever it feels attraction to.

And that strange gravity,
never ends.

Just the moment you grasp a subject,
your mind will slide towards a branch of it.

An upgraded direction,
that builds on top of what you have just learned...

Will begin calling to you,
will begin attracting you.

The different branches,
are not an endless road.

They are a circular cycle,
as old branches will call out as well.

It is a dance that encompasses,
the constellation of your curiosities.

And which is more, it is an act,
of growing all the way up.
