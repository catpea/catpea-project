Imagine an Astronaut,
who spent a lot of time at the ISS.

Or a person recovering from injury, or why not both,
they are a OK; but lost a lot of muscle mass.

And visualize them at the machine,
that you are using at the gym.

Imagine them performing your sets and reps,
and resting, and sitting.

---

And answer me this,
will your excessive restore their lost muscle mass?

Think about it, close your eyes, take a moment,
think about them actually going through the same motions as you do.

---

Let me get you even more involved,
imagine that you are tasked with helping them recover.

They are both professionals,
and they need quick results.

You will be reward,
handsomely once they recover.

---

Please, please, answer me,
will your exercise restore their muscle mass?...

---

Now, how would you do it,
what would work?

Full body exercise, first of all,
which means twisting and turning to a cycle of standing dumbbell exercises.

Cycling standing dumbbell exercises means,
they switch whenever their muscles get tired.

But they don’t really stop,
they go from biceps, or lifting in front, to lifting above without skipping a beat.

---

To make the exercise doable, use drums,
or beats of songs, make them move with the beat, to help them enter a trance.

And to make it, have a profound effect on the body,
start them in the beginning of the rack.

Not so light that they can lift more,
but not so heavy that they must stop.

---

And now to tie it all together,
we make it one hour per day, and 5 days a week.

And you are correct to assume that lifting non-stop,
to the beat of slow songs, is too had, even with 3 pounds.

But this is not a matter of strengths, but endurance,
that is why, we rely on the jogger wisdom here.

First of all we don’t coll it exercise,
until it is non stop for one hour.

We instead refer to it as training,
for exercise; until they close all the rest gaps.

And you can have them use an interval timer here,
emphasizing that the point is to eliminate rest periods.

---

So let us recap,
calling this transformation exercise what it is.

Aerobics, which slows down to bodybuilding,
under eventually heavy dumbbells.

Dumbbells under constant watch not to be too light,
nor so heavy that they force the _dancer_ to stop.

Initially there is a training phase,
a real struggle with elimination of rest by increasing endurance.

And then once they can work out for an hour straight,
it is all about standing dumbbell exercise cycle and bodybuilding.

Because their body is given time to adapt,
under weights configured to be lifted for an hour.

There is no limit how far they can take their musculature,
and no problem with balance ans aesthetics.

As the body is simply allowed to grow in a natural sequence,
without the ineffective by contrast, idea, of muscle isolation.

---

In closing,
your fitness measuring stick...

Is whether or not your own exercise routine,
would work to help people recover from heavy muscle atrophy.

If not, then your routine does not work,
and probably just cuts off your circulation.

Your weights being so heavy, that the exercise does not work,
and you aren’t even lifting for long enough for your body to care.

And if that is the case, then you have my permission
to use this fine measuring stick.

To metaphysically whack the person that has misled you,
into thinking that muscle isolation and sets and reps are an effective routine.
