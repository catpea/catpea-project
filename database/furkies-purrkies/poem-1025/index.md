What artists can’t tell you, won’t tell you,
is that [they traced what they first drew][1].

Tracing helps you study your art,
before you sit down to add your heart.

What makes an artist is trying hard, until you actually trace,
not giving up creates that much needed head space.

If you cannot wait for you art to rule,
get a pen and tablet and use Krita’s image reference tool.

If you tried and failed and feel like sour grapes,
[buy a wall projector][2], and you trace your shapes.

Artists can’t comprehend,
that we all need art to rise and properly stand.

In life, obedience and following, and being scared,
makes us ill prepared.

Art is the middle ground of the much needed defiance,
it is there to help you move past it, into Philosophy and Science.

All that science ask for, is to think clearly and magnificently,
whatever your field to approach it gently.

Once you start creating your first artistic traces,
you will connect with the Muses and Graces.

Your hands will change, and it won’t take long,
tracing is just the first step, soon you will feel like you belong.

With Splendor and Brilliance, Charm and Beauty, Joy Of Life and Laughter,
the Muses will call to you, soon thereafter.

Knowing that art was always in you,
that it is in your bone and sinew.

That art,
is rooted deep in your heart.

The muses of Tragedy, and Comedy, Astronomy, and History,
Dance and Poetry, Romantic, Epic, Inspirational, Musical will unravel every mystery.

Art is how we first learn to stand tall,
it all starts by tracing selfies, or projecting them on a wall.


Afterword,

Almost by definition everything we know about art is wrong,
art will resist by simply moving into the opposite direction of what we say it is.

Don’t try to classify, what thrives of proving you wrong,
bu there is something you should know.

There is,
something.

An artist, has a beginning,
and an artist expands in concert with hat beginning.

Heartless, mindless critics, call it style,
but what it is is a story.

Your early art maybe more important,
than your final masterpiece, protect it.

The full story told by your art,
belongs in an expensive, heavy and thick book.

And there is a rule, that cannot be broken,
it is not possible to break this one.

So take it deep into your heart,
where fire for it now burns.

Remember this as you rise,
true art, changes lives for better.
