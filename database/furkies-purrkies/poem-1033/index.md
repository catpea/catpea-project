Programming is a thing for humans,
it is a talent we all have.

---

When I was a baby,
I had a thing about pixels.

But back then, I saw programming,
as telling the computer what to do line by line.

I would say, something like, go to 0,0,
start a line, and now go to 10,10, and now 20,20.

I could just plot a line,
by moving to different coordinates.

---

I had a lot to learn about computers,
for many years, I would just open shareware…

Figure out how it works,
close it an never use it again.

I learned how to make web pages,
and developed a hunger for making a window this time.

But not just any window,
it had to be empty, it had to be for me to program.

Just as soon as I got it open,
I needed a button to do something.

And when I clicked it,
I was thrown into a code editor, in the middle of a function.

It was something like the name that I gave to the button,
followed by underscore, and the word click, yum.

Click, was an event name,
you could also trigger a DblClick very cool.

---

This was no longer, line by line,
here I was jumping into a really long program - divided into functions.

Things didn’t flow anymore,
they jumped.

---

All the important programming was done with functions,
you made functions, you called other function from within functions, it was Fun.

---

Then,
it got really weird.

---

It was necessary, because once you had hundreds of functions,
you had to categorize, organize, refactor, and that was boring.

This idea of a bag came up,
basically, you could bag a bunch of related functions together.

People always give the example of a cat, or person,
but the example of a File is best.

If you put all your file functions like move, copy, delete,
into a File bag, then you would have everything in one place.

---

Cool,
beans.

---

You still wrote functions everywhere,
but inside an object, they were called methods.

---

It got weirder,
suUuper weird.

---

Since you can nest objects by saying,
this object has a list object.

And list objects can contain other objects,
that also contain lists of objects.

You can make a game by saying Room has a list named doors,
that contains other Rooms.

Or travel the universe by saying new Location,
name edge of universe, add a transporter room…

Teleport to Earth,
the program would beep…

Object earth, has not yet been defined,
do __you__ want to describe it?

---

My favorite object is a radio,
I almost always put one inside my programs.

I make all the program components listen to it,
and then just emit messages, like changeBackground image sunny,jpg.

I don’t have to think about where the function for it is,
I just broadcast the message, and I know the function will hear it.
