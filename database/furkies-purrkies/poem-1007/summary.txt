Purrgramming Tutorial: What Is A Variable And Beyooond!
Friday • December 2nd 2022 • 8:46:44 pm

It is like an allegory,
over computer memory.

Once you start writing spaghetti code,
preferably in JavaScript, for node.

You’ll find programming is easy peasy,
so as long as you don’t let it make you dizzy.

Therein you will discover variables,
often used in function calls.

---

They can store strings of letters,
which are as useful as winter sweaters.

And they can even hold numbers,
which is as useful as crispy cucumbers.

---

They reference complex objects often shared,
so that computer memory isn’t sacred.

One of the nicest objects is an array,
which can keep related numbers at bay.

The object is a fancy thing in it self,
it stores things by name like a bookshelf.

But it can also be as simple as a Cat,
referencing it self with this or that.

Give it a property of __name__,
and you can start writing a little game.

Name the cat Alice
and say location equals palace.


Make an object named room,
that can have a list of doors and boom.

You can now connect rooms with doors,
and they don’t even need floors.

---

Be it objects, numbers or strings,
variables help you glue things.

---

Take a JavaScript tutorial or two,
and programming will start calling to you.

Beyond that, there isn’t that much more,
functions, ifs, and loops get you through the door.

Functions are black boxes,
as clever as foxes.

If statements ask about things,
and give the control flow wings.

And loops only loop over lists,
programming is easy, there are no twists.

---

You can write [little programs][1] right now,
just find the [programming tutorial][2] that’s your meow.
