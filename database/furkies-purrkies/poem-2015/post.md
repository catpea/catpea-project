People lie, to make themselves look more important,
or less of a bumpkin.

And dangerous myths,
are spread by profoundly stupid men.

---

But reality can't be twisted,
life demands health.

You can’t create energy out of things other than food,
that is just not possible.

If you can afford to eat healthy,
you don’t even need a protein supplement.

---

If you are always tired,
because you don’t get enough sleep.

You need to get more sleep,
there is no substitute for sleep.

---

From now on, recognize these lying men,
as pretenders, manipulators, and failures.

And in return,
I will explain to you how it is done.

---

The rule for building muscle,
is this.

“Lift light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy that you must stop.”

---

There are several people at my gym,
that lift too heavy, and must stop, imediatley.

They think that their muscles fail,
and they must now, wait to recover.

But it just maybe, that they are simply,
interfering with their circulation in some strange way.

And this interference,
does not build muscle.

Lifting for 10 seconds, and sitting for 3 minutes,
does not build muscle.

This method is a lie, likely,
spread by fat dads.

Who got all too comfortable,
having an answer for everything.

---

Lowering your weight to lift for minutes,
instead of seconds.

Allowing yourself rest,
for just about the same, 3 minutes.

And then, using an interval timer,
to slowly eliminate the rest periods.

While still lifting light,
but not so light that you can lift more.

Is the training,
for bodybuilding.

Once you can flex and turn, and dance,
with dumbbells for a full hour.

You then begin bodybuilding,
by simply, moving up by 2.5 pounds per dumbbell.

I recommend,
you slowly mix in heavier dumbbells.

---

Because you are flexing your entire body,
you sweat, that is a huge problem that you must learn to deal with.

Working out in a hot gym, is silly,
I recommend starting your bodybuilding, by jogging with dumbells.

And I hope you are moving into Autumn,
though summer is not too bad when sun is not up.

You sweat, but also air is moving around your body,
as you slowly jog.

---

Bodybuilding done this way,
takes months.

It takes years if you want to be huge,
but please, do not stretch your skin.

---

Only the bodybuilding that is done wrong,
requires decades.

---

Finally, you will need focus to perform your exercises,
for prolonged periods.

That means fresh music evey week,
good luck – and I mean that.

I now dance to Latin Oldies,
making my way towards Appalachian Country.

You must dance, to enter a fast forward time trance,
you have to hit every beat of your song.

It makes a three hour workout,
fell like minutes.

But you also have to move away from distractions,
be good to yourself.

---

Jogger endurance, good food and fresh fresh music,
are the only reliable of energy.

Build a safe, life long dance routine,
that will first build, and then just let you keep what you have.

Stay in the keyhole, lift light though not so light that you could lift more,
and never, ever, ever, so heavy that you are forced to stop and sit.
