We are delicate creatures, with a lifespan that should be even longer,
and anyway life cannot come with a full guarantee.

We are born of fundamental principles of physics and chemistry,
and such a large number of tries.

That it would be very strange indeed,
had we not emerged from all this chaos.

We are perpetually tuned by evolution,
but not for our happiness, or achievement, or greatness.

But more like a river, or slime mold,
it is just a different aim, different path.

And from that divergence,
and withing our limits, we will discover many hardships.

Life is a miracle of the universe, and it is your miracle,
and you are not allowed to bow to any weight, no matter how crushing.

That is why growing all the way up is necessary,
that is why greatness is not optional.

To protect whatever pieces are left,
and when everything turns to dust, to keep the memories safe.

First as miracles within,
and then as part of your legacy.

Which is meant to carry your miracles forward,
so that they become treasured by others, in their greatness.

It is indeed true that you will be known among the stars,
for your poems.

Greatness is not just about accepting your intellectual inheritance,
or growing to become a proper adult, by standing on the shoulders of giants.

It is an integral part of the structure of a Human Being,
that many other components will integrate with, and depend on.

In greatness you become, unlimited, unbreakable, unshakable,
and fearless, and endless, and authentic, and wise.

The path of greatness has been carved since before the modern human,
it the the best of human culture, and our most powerful  and meaningful heritage.

If overwork, stress, and tragedy has you down,
firmly plant your fists in the concrete along with its sand.

And rise to your knees, and feet,
and steady yourself.

Find a library and non-fiction books about clear thinking great beings,
philosophers, and beings who left positive and lasting contributions.

Bring your books to a dark beach where you can see all the stars,
the same way that you saw them first.

And as you stand there on the edge of the universe,
reconnect with it, in your brilliance, and your beautiful mind.

Each time you find your way to the beginning,
you are wiser, more powerful, and your mind more precious.

You will be too busy to notice the last loop youâ€™ll need,
before you bloom to no end.
