It is the second time that I encountered a person,
who was manipulated into a lie.

It unraveled in his mind,
the moment he said it out loud.

And it was awful to hear,
and sad.

His mom tricked him into the simple belief,
that phones cause cancer.

The first time I encountered such a thing,
the lie was for the mother’s own amusement.

This one said that fairies,
were stealing sugar in his house.

I am sure they face more lies, the lad with the phone radiation problem.
also added that people plug into the phone and stare at the screen.

This type of thing, above all,
is frightening.

Because it makes the person appear,
unstable or unhinged.

It is unnecessary,
because they just need a couple of books.

The Compleat Gentleman, if you skip the ending confessions,
and probably Short History of Nearly Everything.

The mother needs that too,
she need to re-listen to Short History, and probably Demon Haunted world…

At least a dozen times,
and see that boys are not pigs to control.

They just need to hear
about Philosophers and Gentlemen, and they’ll take it from there.

---

This type of lying is the basis of Psychological Control,
called indoctrination.

Indoctrination was historically used by Witch Doctors and Religions,
mostly for control, but also for easy warfare.

---

Rather than lying to children,
understand that you have not received education.

Your teachers tricked you with tests and GPA,
and now is the time, to listen to science popularizer books.

Don’t tell anybody about your narrated books,
just re-listen to them countless times.

Get mad at ineffective education,
and teach your boy to be a Gentleman.

In fact, you will do him a great favor,
because what TV and Phones teach is absurd, and very painful.

Whoever frightened you into thinking that boys are awful,
was a victim of indoctrination into a crappy culture, him self.

---

If you pushed religion onto your child,
things get more complex.

But you can pull him out,
for the same reason why you put him in there.

But think about the story of Mary,
what that story really is about.

How the church remains silent on crimes against women,
and presents the woman as a temptress, something made out of a rib.

You can talk about what the Monks did to Joan Of Arc,
to make sure that she did not end up in heaven because she was pure.

Jon Krakauer’s Missula, will show him that there is no substitute,
for becoming a Gentleman, no lie, no fantasy, no religion.

The gentleman has been destroyed by our culture,
because they have their own moral compass and are in fact incorruptible.

---

If you think this is uncomfortable,
you might want to grab a chair.

You have betrayed your son, or children,
and now you have to fix it.

When the young gentleman spoke to me about phones causing cancer,
he knew it was a lie, and that a rift is forming.

You must avoid this,
at all cost.

So, you will need to rebond,
reconnect, this time with narrated books playing in your ears.

With the common understanding, that you both learn,
that although the [radiation][1] that the phone is emitting is on the same spectrum.

Radio waves, are not powerful enough,
to cause damage to DNA.

You will learn this from Science Popuarizing books,
as you bond on the Appalachian Trail, or small parts of it as your legs allow.

---

You both need to understand that you were betrayed by teachers,
and received an ineffective education, which is to say inauthentic education.

Get mad at schools teaching nothing about morals,
or making ladies and gentlemen seem dated.

And write, with the help of AI,
that you scared your boy away from.

Write about the real stories,
that are hidden from us.

And the real education,
that is denied to us.

Write for the love of life,
and be sure to narrate your books as well.

Your boy will always find you on the trails,
and your voice will always guide him to the truth and your love.

---

You’ve done the best you could under the circumstances,
but now, you know more, and you have to pack for adventure, Mam.

I’d wish you luck,
but I know you make your own.
