I just asked a leading ai to create a PEG Parser Generator in JavaScript,
with XML grammar example – [it threw in a User interface, and it all worked][0].

[PEG][1] is for computer nerds, it stands for Parsing Expression Grammar,
and it converts source code from text into something computers can work with.

If I was just lucky, then it is still an improvement over chicken scratch,
but I don’t think I was lucky, I think we live in a new world.

I still asked my other AI, and saw a mediocre answer,
and an chicken one, where I needed to remind it use the modern JavaScript.

It is harder to make a case for AI just being a parrot,
or glorified auto-complete.

Originally the XML grammar for the Peg Parser Generator I asked for, was text,
but I suspected there were issues there.

So I told the AI to use a programming object,
and it was talking to it self, they all do it, now.

Getting an auto-complete,
to have a chat with it self works.

It is not the AI that programmers have imagined,
but it is an AI that actually works.

---

It is no longer rational behavior,
to be cranky about the AI we have today,

But I will add, that I believe the update that made the PEG/Grammar possible,
if just two or three weeks old.

And note that, compared to what we had a couple of years ago,
the AI is hundreds of times cheaper to run, and way smarter.

These are the kinds of things, that indicate continued success,
leading up to a series of amazing surprises.

How does this affect the average person,
why should anybody care?

Because you have a teacher of programming,
and a programmer WILL write amazing code for you.

I suspect my AI was basing the code not off of other open source projects,
but scientific publications, white papers.

If we are not there yet,
then we are probably weeks away.

If you were to start learning programming,
you get to pick your own direction now.

Game Development, or writing your own programming language,
writing a better anything is game too.

The AI will divide it up for you,
and you start in the beginning.

You will not get stuck,
because you have a programmer.

You get to soak up close slowly,
by watching the AI code.

Instead of sharply,
by trying to wrap your mind about OOP polymorphism.

I recently wrote about parents, keeping their kids away from internet,
when done correctly that is wise.

But, with the kind of free AI that we have now,
it needs to be recognized as a teacher.

And young people need to learn programming form it,
there is no school in the world, nor will there ever be.

That will ever accomplish, what the free AI can do without any effort,
give young people a personalized programming education.

Whether they want med school, or to become a boxer,
AI will take programming straight into that area.

Simulations, games, even learning help,
the free AI I talked to today can probably make Concept Maps and MindMaps.

And customizing them, learning the programming required,
not to do it, but to know what to ask and how, is now really important.

These little programs, can grow into precious companies,
they will set the student free from poverty.

Even my parser generator, which I only meant as a test,
can become a good business.

Because the AI, appears to be capable of creating,
custom programming languages.

A perfect fit language, can become a precious tactic,
for approaching complex tasks that combine many technologies.

---

But any idea, now, can grow into a future,
it just needs an operator that likes it.

In context of a student, this represents both mastery of programming,
and the resulting swift rise out of poverty, with powerful help from AI.

Where schools waste years of students time on scatter-brain education,
the AI can now use those years to create a powerful programmer.
