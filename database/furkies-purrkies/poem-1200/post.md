The world has only had a few good leaders and for a short while,
everyone else only ever cared for their own interests.

The most powerful of tactics are always at play, confusion, un-education,
war, indoctrination, fear, doubt, disbelief, hate, division, and even slavery.

If the interests of these hollow creatures are threatened,
they will send your children and grand children to war, to simply restart the economy,

Please, don’t let your world make you think that cramming in school,
or secretly doing drugs in your car, or becoming a liar, or a bully…

Is some kind of a winning move, the path of nothing ever, neverwhere,
is just the path that the ghouls prefer you to walk.

Parasites always want their prey to feel small,
they want you, to fear, to hide, to never learn, and never speak out.

---

The only winning move, is growing all the way up,
until you become a great being, and exit all your cages.

Please know, you are not alone, and even if everyone is attacking you,
you still have your older self.

Wherever you are today, the older you, is wishing,
that you fought, that you rose, that you stood up, so that your future was better.

The choices you make today,
affect the older you in the most profound of ways.

Rip yourself out of the poison that surrounds you,
leave all that makes you ill behind.

Make your way towards narrated books – you just need to listen,
and know that it takes a while to find who the great beings are.

The level of your knowledge greatly influences,
which books you will understand first.

You have to find the correct combination,
and even then re-listen countless many times…

You don’t just want to understand what is being said,
but inherit the best parts of the greatness of the authors, as well.

Take to adventure, to clear your mind,
and walk the trails where others are rising too.

May the great beings who wrote your most beloved books,
keep you company in all of your adventures...

May they kindle your flame for more,
and may they help you grow to no end.
