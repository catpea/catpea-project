There are so many cat questions and so little time,
that not asking these questions should be a crime.

---

Why in the heck do the male lions have the mane,
why should the lion girls look plain.

And how come cats don’t seem to howl,
they just have a meow, purr, and a growl?

And why did cats invent the art,
of trying to trick us into thinking they aren’t super smart.

I am certain that they lay on the keyboard,
to steal passwords, for when they need to take over the world.

And, I suspect cats think humans are retarded,
and the lack of the tail is probably how it all started.

---

Plus tomorrow is hunters moon,
the cat’s monthly holiday when they dance to their own tune.

Forget about petting a stray,
they’ll scratch you up before you can say “Hey!”.

If humans are from earth, considering the cat’s tune,
the cats probably came from the moon.

The bane of every balloon, baboon, raccoon, and human buffoon,
that just wants to sleep all afternoon.

Until early morning hour,
when they go full power.

---

What are we to learn from all these observations?
Well, cats are really well suited to run all the world’s nations.

By granting them all the political power,
we would solve all conflicts within the first hour.

And after all the fighting and complains would cease,
lady lions could finally order some fancy wigs in peace.

I for one prefer lady lions, over democrats,
but I wouldn't mind if the world was ran by house cats.
