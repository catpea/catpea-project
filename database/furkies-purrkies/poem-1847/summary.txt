A Beautiful Workout For Girls
Saturday • March 22nd 2025 • 10:21:46 pm

Sets and reps only work once,
because they challenge the body once.

Initially, when switching,
from no gym, to gym.

This process can’t be re-created,
because everyone ends up lifting too heavy.

Too heavy,
means, it is not possible to lift for longer.

And if you aren’t lifting for long enough,
then you won’t be able to lift heavier.

---

Therefore, sets and reps,
are not a strategy.

They may be some fragment,
of a bloated one.

Or a myth made up,
based on bodybuilders showing off.

Lifting 3 sets of 10 times,
is convenient for a TV crew.

Or good for showing off,
among boys.

But it does nothing,
for making continued progress.

---

And muscle isolation can only slow you down,
you need a full body exercise.

All the machines, and I am sorry to say,
even the racks, are a bad idea.

And lifting super-heavy,
will result in back injury, just don’t do it.

As you are about to see,
Good workouts that provide great results...

Are simple, clear,
and rational.

---

1980’s aerobics craze,
demonstrates a full body exerciser.

What was left out, however,
is that, you don’t stop.

You cycle standing,
dumbbell exercises to rest muscle groups.

And it is really best to power walk,
rather than stand in place.

---

If you are just starting,
before you establish a workout.

You must train for it,
which means, eliminating rest.

You can achieve that,
by just walking with 3lb dumbbells.

But as soon as you make it,
through the hour…

The training phase, ends,
and you begin your life long workout.

It is always just dumbbells,
but as soon as you can.

Find a way to safety,
lift them above your head as well.

That will give you shoulders
and add to your abdominal.

---

There is a very important rule,
that you must adhere to.

Lift light,
but no so light that you can lift more.

And never so heavy,
that you must stop.

You can see how this will keep going,
as your body adapts.

---

If you want big muscle,
move to slow music.

One beat, lift up,
next beat lower down.

Less, than 100 beats per minute (BPM),
will help you lift heavy.

Songs that are below 90BPM,
are a more advanced workout you can explore.

If you want an athletic body,
move fast, 145 bpm or more.

Slow, mans you lift heavy,
fast, will keep you at 7 to 10lb per hand.

And you will be able to jog,
and you can just go slow.

---

There cannot be a workout,
without music.

It is not just,
about the tempo.

Hitting every beat,
helps you enter a dance trace.

That makes time pass faster,
turns 4 hours into 10 minutes.

You will need pretty,
and fresh songs.

And they are like,
non-rechargeable batteries.

Once you deplete a song,
with a few weeks of dancing.

The song energy,
never returns.

---

The workout is every day,
until you you see benefits.

In taking a day off,
make it two, then.

---

This is already a beautiful workout,
as it helps you twist and turn.

And it give you results weekly,
and makes you look mighty.

But, to make it even more beautiful,
begin shuffle dancing with dumbbells.

You may need zero drop,
wide toe-box shoes, and sandy concrete.

This way you can slide your shoe,
very easily.

Your shoes won’t last long,
but avoid thick soles or raised heels.

That can only result in pump bump,
dancing puts a lot of stress on your feet.

---

Wait for your body to adapt,
before moving to the next weight.

Our musculature is complex,
it is a symphony orchestra.

The muscle will keep you safe,
and moving gradually, free of injury.

---

Mornings, are probably best,
for your workout.

Because of fresh and crisp air,
and relatively cool weather.

---

Though you can easily dip,
into hard bodybuilding.

Lighter weights make this,
a life long fitness routine.

That in it self,
adds to the beauty of it.

Lastly, if you need a beautiful way,
to get into shape, consider hiking.

Perhaps even the Appalachian Trail,
or the Triple Crown.

The Appalachian, Pacific Crest,
and Continental Divide.
