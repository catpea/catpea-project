For their workout to work out,
some people require a change of scenery.

This almost certainly means, a number of State Parks,
never just one, and an adventure mind set.

And I say State Parks, frankly, because they are built for people,
with a class higher than that of a filthy animal, that but need a tree.

There are showers, bathrooms, a cute little store,
and maybe a lake, a river, a shore, and a tidy fire ring with sticks and matches.

Now let me be clear, about a very important key point I am making here,
and grab on to something, maybe, because this is some amazing new information:

A State Park,
is a gym.

Let me repeat that, those treadmills in your gym,
are unrolled at a state park, and called trails.

A state park is a gym, with good kinds of smells,
where the scenery always changes.

They don’t have dumbbells,
you can bring your 3 or 5 pound ones.

Or make your own dumbbell weighted walking sticks,
but I recommend mighty walking sticks.

Heavy dry behemoths, that have long fallen, but with a thud,
ones that invite ridicule are especially nice.

Because then you can explain, you are not just hiking,
what you are doing is a body building power hike.

You tell them, put them right in their place,
with their pointy little ultra light aluminum sticks.

Then you better whip out the gallon jug of water you carry in your pack,
flex your biceps, take a chug and a gurgle, and spit the precious fluid out.

Cause you got more than enough,
especially when compared to their skinny bottles – you show them.

And then take your leave,
making such little thuds with your walking sticks…

That all the smelly bigfoots,
will scurry and scamper a mile and half away, yes.

---

We trick ourselves that a gym is needed for working out,
but all it is, is a big umbrella, with clean bathrooms and showers.

If you bring dumbbells and a umbrella to the state park,
you get the same thing…

Minus the gagging from several new sign-ups in the back,
all discovering at the same time, the terrible curse of extra proteins in the diet.

---

Just power walking with dumbbells and a weighted backpack,
is a wonderful start.

And even if it rains a little,
because then the air, the atmosphere comes alive.

But that is only a start, if you add a tent to your gear,
and camp a couple of hours during the day, after a snack…

The adventure,
will become an expedition.

And if you stay the night, and later become,
a power hiking weekend warrior…

Who knows how many times faster you can transform your body,
compared to dancing with dumbbells at the gym.

---

And if you stay, a week, and a month,
maybe two.

Then you will shatter all your unhealthy eating habits,
and burn up all the fat, from just walking or exploring around with a pack and dumbbells.

And yes, yes, yes,
the [Triple Crown][1] will call out to you.

The trails are a magnificent workout,
walking 20 miles a day, is more transformative than any workout at any gym.

---

Finally, add narrated books to your Power Hiking,
there are few things more marvelous…

Than walking a trail,
while listening to impossible adventures on another.

You will make the book adventure come a live,
and if there are any bears in it, that will sure make for an interesting couple of evenings.

But don’t be too scared, you are learning about nature, and parks are safe,
and the lighting and thunder have been making a ruckus for billions of years.

It is all as it should be,
reconnect with nature.
