We are all one family,
what divides us, is education.

And the thing that makes education hard,
is actually, just poverty.

The world’s lack of real education,
is perfectly reinforced by poverty.

In a lot of ways,
poverty prevents education.

---

One of the first lessons,
once we do get to books.

Is that we,
are the creators of our world.

The way the world is,
is made by each and every one of us.

---

But because of lack of education,
we can’t agree on anything.

As a result we allow war,
we tolerate Nuclear Weapons.

We think that Poverty,
and Homelessness, just happens.

That the things we create,
are bad luck.

---

No,
we all join in to create it.

We even wipe from our minds how we remove park benches,
and put spikes, where the homeless feel safe.

---

It is true that no one votes,
on these terrible things.

But they do emerge out of our disagreement,
which is rooted in our lack of education.

---

Most people think,
education happens in school.

But all that real education is,
is growing all the way up…

---

All the way, until we all,
become great beings.

Growing up,
is not aging.

Growing up is about inheriting knowledge
from place no other than narrated, books.

Books written by other great beings,
most often from other generations.

Not just reading them, but narrating,
comprehending, acting out, accepting the greatest of our wisdoms.


---

Our knowledge, wisdom and greatness,
both inherited an synthesized…

Serves as our operating system,
a system of perceptions, comprehension, experiences, and choices.

When we don’t inherit from wise books,
we end up perpetuating the way things are.

Because we effectively end up starting at zero,
repeating the mistakes of the previous generations.

And the evil emerging out of the chaos,
is not yet that bad.

There is no Nuclear war,
no run-away climate change.

---

But that does not mean we can see greatness,
as optional, quite to the contrary.

It means that we must all become Great Beings,
as soon as possible, to prevent the worst of it.

---

It is really hard,
to pick out a life-changing narrated-book at the library.

And it is even harder, for a stressed out person,
to hang on to the story.

To befriend the author,
to travel in space or time, and to inherit class and wisdom.

But we have to,
so that we can all understand and repair everything.

We must each, become, a Great Being,
grow, grow all the way up, and to see an understand everything.

To make our world,
ever more beautiful.
