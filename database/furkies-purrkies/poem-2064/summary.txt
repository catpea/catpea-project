You Become As Flexible As Your Dance Moves
Friday • October 24th 2025 • 10:35:46 pm

We are animals not furniture,
we have to dance and flex.

Perfect posture during workout,
is dangerous and silly.

When you flex and dance,
your entire body gets a workout.

When you copy everyone else,
you go from engaging 650 muscles to two.

Standing still ensures,
there aren’t enough hours in the day to get a workout.

Posture is a lie,
made up by people pretending to know something.

Bu that something,
was actually nothing.

---

Both workout and bodybuilding,
is painfully simple.

First you jog for an hour,
then for an hour with dumbbells.

And then you just keep lifting heavier,
at the gym, still without any rest.

---

Don’t call it a workout,
call it must become.

Dancing,
with dumbbells.

It is sad when you hurt your back,
that only makes you more out of shape.

You have to flex and flow,
slowly advancing by 2.5 pounds.

Lift light,
but not so light that you can lift more.

And never so heavy,
that you must stop.

There is no such thing as muscle failure,
you are just cutting off your circulation.

---

Your gym teacher wasn’t muscular,
he was sucking in his stomach.

They are all pretending,
reading from a script.

Written by men,
who get paid by looking busy.

Say no to Ms. Shmeasels,
say no to Mr. Toerag.

Tell them that fitness is endurance,
tell them that only dance will work.

That our bodies to adapt,
need broad sustained signals.

And that can only mean,
starting with endurance.

Similar to Aerobics,
and letting our bodies adapt past it.

Onward to a litter bit heavier weights,
slowly lifting more as hour bodies adapt.

If you must stop,
you are doing it wrong.

Start by walking for an hour,
then at a faster pace.

Slowly jog,
add 3 lb. dumbbells.

And keep moving up in weight,
as your body slowly adapts.

Synchronize your motion,
with beats of your songs.

To enter a dance trance,
that accelerate time.

And finally start flexing,
and turning at the gym.

Dance your way,
into your future.
