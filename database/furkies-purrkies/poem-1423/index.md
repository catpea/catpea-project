In da land of fuzz n' fluff, I iz tiny kitten,
Big world around, by curiosity I am bitten,

Each ting I see, each sound dat's written,
In ma head, knowledge begins to smitten.

Chasin' shadows, movin' widout a blunder,
I lurnz of light, and darkness yonder,

Each tail chase, moments to ponder,
Knowledge haz a magic, drawing me fonder.

Birds fly high, bugs in grass do lies,
Through kitten eyes, all prize.

From morning sun to moonrise, I lurnz,
I grows, in oh so many guise.

Mice may scuttle, yarns twist n' turn,
But curiosity's fire will always burn.

In da journey of life, each and every turn,
A lesson learned, sum wisdom earned.

In da whiskers twitch, in claw and paw,
In life's grand mystery, I finds da law.

Vision 'n experience, like openin' a door,
Brings forth da wisdom, never seen before.

Into greatness, like chasin' light beam,
Carrying knowledge, wid a dream.

In da meows and purrs, you can deem,
In dis amazing world, I've found ma gleam.
