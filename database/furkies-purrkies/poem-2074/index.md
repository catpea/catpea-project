It does not take much imagination for you to see,
how inconvenient that person is to everybody.

And that’s on top of all the other inconveniences,
they maybe small by contrast, but they are plentiful.

One AI blogger looked deep into his soul,
and said his greatest fear.

Is that AI will genetically engineer us,
from the wolves that we are today, into corgis.

Well, wow, he really looked into the dark corners of his soul,
because we are not wolves, we have been conquered already.

And thank goodness, that the enemy is the ignorant,
and profoundly arrogant us.

Because if a real enemy had this power over us,
we woudn't know how to read or even that cities exist.

We would be taught that thinking is evil,
and if you were truly exceptional.

That an educated servant,
is not a needed servant.

In computer programming,
there is a phenomenon called bit flipping.

Bits get flipped by interference,
it just happens sometimes.

---

Out bits got flipped,
lots of them.

School is not a convenient babysitter,
and education is supposed to be effective.

Learning is what we do, and it must happen in the sequence,
that arises in our minds.

To tell someone what to learn,
is to interfere with their education, and cause great harm.

I expect there are thousands of such bits,
and each one more upsetting than the previous.

---

But, the end result,
is the prevention of the maturing of a mind into genius.

It is a convenient lie to believe that only some,
are exceptional.

This way, the principals,
can just mark one or two students as gifted.

And feel they have done something great,
while still disrupting and harming the minds of so many.

Your very parents,
likely found your lack of genius convenient.

And the same goes for you,
learning on top of all the other crap you have to put up with.

---

Those are flipped bits,
they are not OK.

If you ever notice that you don’t feel yourself,
and your life is not entirely yours.

That is correct, you are a learner denied,
in a rat race for multiple reasons.

But you can’t do this to yourself,
to others, to future generations.

You may not stand by,
or just stand at the picket line as your world ends.

You are supposed to learn,
and teach lessons worthy of your listeners time.

[Your very first steps are dangerous][1],
frightening, and you will find no comfort at all.

But whether you like it or not,
you are a protector of this world.

And we may only go forward,
wisdom is the first and foremost.

As that is our finest language,
and greatest shared vision.

---

Cramming in High School,
in a fake education setting overall.

Where you didn’t even have a chance…
means you did not graduate.

You still have to learn,
you still have to grow.

You still have to conquer your fears,
find your wisdom and even adventure.

And you have to take time to understand,
that it is not just about getting up to genius.

To grow up, means to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.
