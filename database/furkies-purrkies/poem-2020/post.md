The first thing I talked about,
once I somewhat learned English enough to speak it.

Is that mastery of letters, words,
sentences, punctuation, numbers.

And writing, reading, and speaking
is proof that genius is everywhere, it is what makes us human.

Whatever talents happen at random,
pale in contrast to thing that we put effort in.

No child is born being able to write and read,
or code computer programs.

Normally, we assume that going into Science,
maybe Medicine and perhaps Philosophy is where genius shines.

But, mastery of language,
shows that we don’t have to wait through decades long journeys.

So what are the other things,
that help our minds grow?

---

The hiker and adventurer, who both answers the call of wild,
and the books about adventure – gains extremely powerful intelligence.

They carry themselves differently, because they switch,
they live on the path, and when we meet them, they are visiting average lives.

You can almost see that in their eyes too,
the hikers have almost animal eyes.

---

The continent hopper is next,
hen your parents flop you over to another continent.

And you discover that even the sky is different,
your mind doubles – it just does – some call it going crazy.

But your behavior shifts, because your world doubled,
that is why the mind is doubling.

You’ll be at the library, the first year you can read,
even if you never cared for it before.

Lonesome moms who are worried about their children,
only need to uproot them, to make them royal adventurers.

I saw people with cardboard boxes,
home made luggage, it is not expensive.

So as long as you keep rising,
it does not matter how low you start.

Computer programming is next,
you will never know nerd rage.

Until the day you realize how you overestimated complexity of programming,
it is a human tool, for human, you start by watching videos of people coding.

The intelligence does come from the mental gymnastics,
but also the fact it that programming is a microscope.

You can simulate a cell, with the help of AI,
zooming in so far that even Sci-Fi moves barely goes there.

I will try, but there is no describing programming,
it is unlike anything ever experienced by a person new to it.

Ok, you know how there are people who hate board games,
because they are cardboard, slow, and the players are iffy.

Programming is for them,
it is the perfect thing for them.

But, it is also a board game, let us not mince words:
it is a board game made of thoughts.

And the game progresses at the speed of thought,
not light, that’s the speed of programs.

Speed of thought,
is the speed of imagination.

On the inside the world of programming is a 3D fractal,
see if you can find a [3D fractal video][1] or simulator.

You can come close to things, and get a better view,
but also you will discover more detail than you expected.

For example, the moment you think you can iterate over lists,
you discover state machines and lose your mind.

Because a state machine, contains states for unique conditions,
of the elements of the data you are iterating over.

You eliminate nested if statements,
you may even replace everything with a reducer that swaps states to match data.


---

The final height, that represents an infinity,
is described with a single world, but I can’t just say it.

Let us do it this way, it is digital, rechargeable, you bring it on adventure,
it has replay, and pause.

These are not books the way you know them from school,
narrated books are movies that may last for 20 hours.

They are fascinating, and you fall asleep,
because they also become their lullaby.

Remember you take them on adventure,
you are incapable of comprehension without the training of adventure.

They are good medicine too, eople who need healing or culture,
also greatly, impossibly benefit.

Because reading a book, takes something away from inheriting from it,
we are story listeners and story tellers.

Listening to books, helps you inherit their wisdom, the lives within,
but also the culture of the characters and the author.

And yes, Adventure and Travel books, completely help you,
to some of that intelligence.

After all, you are transported into adventure,
into many continents, and at different times.


It is this hopping, and inheriting of culture of wisdom,
that multiplies you to no end.

The worm, in book worm, is not a bug as every reader knows,
it is the Einstein Rosen type worm – multidimensional.

And before the part, let us answer,
Can you beat intelligence you get from programming,
by reading books about math and then programming, I think so, I really do.

But programming is so cool, so terrific,
you really, really, really, wouldn't want to.

I interdependently reinvented an interval timer once,
using Android Programming Environment and Rhino, on the phone.

I used DTMF beeps like on the phone,
to tell me when to start and when to stop.

I still went to the gym, but after pecking at the android keyboard for two hours,
like a chicken, I needed a nap, like a chicken.
