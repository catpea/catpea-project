Use wisdom,

Get ahead of trouble.

Find them,

find all your ends.

Bring them within,

make a start.

We do not age,

we amplify.

Don't stop,

align in balance.

The slightest push,

is the greatest force.

---

You cannot grow,

without a multiplex.

One thousand,

little audio books.

One thousand lives,

to power your start.

Quickening worthy,

of gods and royalty.

We are unbreakable,

we are truly, Unimaginable.

---

As flowers need water.

we need books.

We have minds,

and those must grow.

Don't listen to anybody,

they are not enough.

You need,

a thousand voices.

A thousand,

lifetimes.

---

Flowers,

need light to bloom.

Our minds need,

a thousand lifetimes.

In darkness,

nothing can bloom.

The curse was never knowing,

that you were to bloom.

One Thousand Books,

and the curse is broken now.

---

Do not be scared,

wisdom is safety.

Do not be worried,

Humanity grows with you.

One for all,

and all of one.

Let the nature trails,

bring you moon and sun.

Slow down and listen,

let the narrators read.

Let a thousand wise beings

speak to you as one.
