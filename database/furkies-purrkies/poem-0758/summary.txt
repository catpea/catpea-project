What is A School Class And What Is It For?
Monday • March 28th 2022 • 3:51:56 pm

This is a question that should only be answered by example,\
because by creating a definition you will enable liars to manipulate unsuspecting students.

I will give you a definition anyway, but only for this poem's sake,\
and I didn't even try to put any effort in it.

"It is a set of honest, authentic, precious and lovely lectures,\
that lead to a life-long and profound, positive change, in a student's life.

But I repeat, this question should only be answered by example,\
liars will use weasel words and trick students into thinking something is profound, when it really isn't.

This is an on-going problem, for an example of this kind of fraud,\
consider the religions that abuse, on prey on the trusting and the loving, and the unsuspecting.

And also note, the size of their enterprise,\
and how many people dip into the profits, important part of which are tax exemptions.

Global, organized fraud, is not only real, but an every-day-fact;\
that people accept by merely being born into a world such a strange idea.

---

You will find curiosity and fascination to be the driving force,\
behind learning.

The standardized curriculum that forces people into subjects they are not interested in,\
are merely fraudulent attempts at taking unsuspecting students money.

Often times, schools evolve to be is so good at it,\
[so cunning, that even the smartest of us, have long been taken advantage of, and will do everything to refuse to believe it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpnxd31y0Fo).

I repeat, the question "What is A College Course Or A School Class",\
can only be defined by example.

---

I will give you,\
three examples.

---

My first example is the Art, or Digital Painting to be precise,\
by starting with a program that allows stretching a semi-transparent reference image over the entire canvas - such as Krita.

The student is not burdened with the questionable idea of hand-eye-coordination that can only lead to slightly crooked paintings,\
and is granted access to the perfect shape and color, thus is ready to create Hyperrealistic Art, on the first lecture.

This is called the kindling of the soul, and not filling of the vessel,\
we halve lost so many artists to fraudulent lectures, that if we knew, our hearts would break.

My se...

...to the more important parts of code, and not bother them with trivialities that they can figure out on their own by reading some documentation.

It is worth mentioning that I was going to break down web programming into programming command-line utilities, writing custom code editors,\
easily building HTTP servers, working on client-side probably with web-components, and explain writing cross platform browser plugins and phone apps.

In the process revealing a single language that can handle it all rather well,\
and I'll just note that it is [modern JavaScript](https://deliciousinsights.github.io/confoo-es2022/#/mainTitle)

---

But there is something more important,\
a class about growing up.

---

And this is not Humanities, Sociology, or Psychology, or even the Mother of All Sciences: Philosophy,\
this class is just called "Growing Up"

There are viruses in our culture, in the culture of every nation, strange and incredibly stupid ideas and rituals,\
and toxic things that all too many have accepted as normal.

We have to talk about simple mistakes that everyone seems to make,\
that often have profoundly NEGATIVE consequences...

And SIMPLY,\
prevent the student from ever ending up in that situation.

This type of class or course, in a free school that is globally accessible,\
will help the world grow wiser and more peaceful.

---

Today, we are neither teaching the correct classes,\
nor do we consider that [each student learns in a unique sequence and at a different pace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY), or time of day, even.

[Schools are so broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4),\
that [even grades are fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY).

---

Modern schools do not seem to care,\
that students cannot learn by repetition and memorization, they can only learn by understanding and comprehending.

Schools have misunderstood the magnificence of the human mind,\
and that we are all extremely intelligent, and geniuses, in more ways than we even recognize.

But most importantly, schools have failed to recognize,\
that to grow up, means to grow all the way up.

Finally, the propose of a **real** school class,\
is to help the world to come together in Peace, and in Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.
