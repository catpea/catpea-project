Humanity’s greatest thoughts, ideas,
and its development is store in books that nobody reads.

Nobody even understands that books are meant to be narrated,
in paper form they are exactly like sheet music.

Just like music, books are meant to be heard,
not passes around as paper.

---  

And due to our uniqueness, natural pace, and existing knowledge,
there cannot be a preset-standardized book path.

A library is like a buffet, is someone tell you to stick to hot dogs,
and have some jello before you leave, you will not return.

---

The world is in a lot of trouble, because human development has ceased,
probably/largely due to the fear and toxicity coming off of poverty.

---

To inherit the wisdom stored in a book requires either distress,
which will be swiftly converted to relief…

As from time to time,
we lose ourselves in the beautiful stories, and incredible adventures.

Or, it requires existing adventure and serenity, which is so hard to come by,
it requires that we take to walking the Appalachian Trail.

---

Which takes many months, often many tries,
and years, facing poverty, facing our fears, and every ache and hunger.

---

Pushing the play button, goes a long way,
but to fully inherit inherit from a hundred or more books.

We must challenge ourselves in our own lives,
we have to stop being payed like piano keys.

We have to exit whatever shortsightedness, manipulations,


And in great strength and dignity,
take to adventure and books.

---

Finally, Daniel Dennett asked the correct question,
“[If Brains are Computers, Who Designs the Software?][1]”

We do, we design the software, we are supposed to get it from the best books,
but we inherit it, from whatever culture we are born into.

Lack of wisdom and knowledge, has been with us so long,
that all the cultures have forgotten to place emphasis on our best ideas.

Our culture, heritage, and Humanity’s future,
is not the soup of behaviors and observations we grow up in.

It is in the world most powerful and meaningful books,
books that help inherit life changing knowledge, that in turn makes the world; a wise peaceful place, for all.

The books held in highest esteem by all the worlds leading intellectuals
and great and clear, thinkers.

Find your first one hundred life chaining books,
you will recognize them, by loving each and every second you listen to them.

And then inherit from,
nine thousand, nine hundred more, just to be sure you found them all.
