We are meant to grow up in beautiful cultures,
where our minds can grow and flourish.

When born to poverty and lack of education,
we get confused and twisted around.

No child is born a criminal, or cruel,
but terrors of poverty and uneducation can make them a bully.

Art especially when aided by helpful tools,
screen projectors, art generators, camera lucida, tracing…

Creates an easy on ramp,
that can help young peole take their first steps up.

With easy beat sequencers and sampling,
music composition is sure to follow.

And then the simple question of,
“What else can I do” helps them to books.

---

Designing a central culture that revolves around beautiful ideas,
does not work.

Because in poverty and uneducation,
liars will always trade whatever goodness there was, for profit.

The people who are still stuck in the old ways,
will tear it apart.

But a gift of 10,000 top selling narrated books,
may just be all that the future needs.

An easy to conceal audio player,
with a vast library of wisdom.

Can bring light,
to the most dangerous places.

All the world’s leading thinkers and meaningful award winners,
sharing their wisdom, and beautiful ideas.

For many young people it will the the first time,
they truly hear beautiful things.

As the books can be played, paused, and and replayed,
at the time, pace, and in sequence that fits them best.
