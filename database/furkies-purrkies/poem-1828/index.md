It is easy to forget that it is not jut Grand and Grand-Grand parents,
but also many generations of brave Or Mighty Hunters and Powerful Warriors.

I am sorry, but so many of your ancestors were survival experts and warriors,
that all your most beautiful family traditions today, pale in comparison.

I do not mean to belittle your traditions at all, but they are small,
when compared to our ancestors who actually fought giant fauna.

Members of your family fought Mammoths and Mastodons,
armadillo like Glyptodons, Giant Ground Sloths (my ancestral spirit animal).

And enormous versions of Lions,
Tigers called Smilodonds (another one of my Sprit animals).

And Dire Wolves, four meter tall Moa Birds,
even Eagles, Bears and Deer, that could gobble you up before you knew it.

In fact, they gobbled up all the people,
that don’t have any babies today.

Vegans have completely forgotten the carnage their ancestors faced,
and that we eat some creatures out of vengeance, oh yes.

If you want to reconnect with your ancestors,
you have to become three really beautiful things to properly honor them.

A great adventurer, very important,
an athlete, not as hard as they show on tv, but you sure become muscular.

And finally, you have to show your mental powers,
it is not enough to become a great artist.

For which you practice with a wall projector,
that helps you study shape and forces you lo master color.

Eventually realizing, that you paint tones, brown and white first,
and then you glaze color over, gently adding subtle hues.

You actually have to become a programmer, JavaScript has the broadest reach,
and Desktop Applications based on Web Browsers are the most powerful.

But, to find your creativity in programming you need to make room for learning,
that can only mean training, like an athlete, to cross the Triple Crown.

The Appalacion Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and The Continental Divide Trail,
and you will see Grizzly Bears out there.

And yes, they are so powerful, that our ancestors,
were unable to eat them, they can smell you long before you notice them.

So as you see them ignoring you,
they are actually letting you be, they only get angry when you get in their way.

You don’t have to walk the triple crown if you don’t want to,
but it has to be the equivalent, two years, with plenty of time to rest your feet.

And you train to walk 20 miles a day, and I highly recommend yo udo so,
with progressive heavier dumbbells, so you go out there as a bodybuilder.

The only way to fight a Grizzly is to stay behind him, the only way to do that,
is to grab onto his guts through his prison pockets, muscles are always useful.

As you can imagine, that is in great part why the grizzlies leave us alone,
most of the time - and who could blame them?

One of the most beautiful discoveries you make out there,
is that nature, makes you hungry for books from the library.

Especially the narrated ones,
where you care really feel the presence of great beings.

Adventures, scientists, philosophers, and great story tellers,
will all join you on your journey to share their wisdom with you.
