If you do what everyone else is doing,
it will take you forever to put on muscle.

---

I suspect, that the huge bodybuilders,
have two secrets childhood obesity, and now zero fat.

Childhood obesity makes it so,
that you begin lifting at 3.

You always gain weight,
you get heavier and unhealthier.

Then when some people mature,
they stop overeating.

And use exercise to remove all the fat,
beneath leas 30 years of putting on muscle.

Obesity is dangerous,
and it is deadly.

----

If you are overweight,
you are also a bodybuilder.

But you have to get away from sugar,
and your lifestyle, and stress.

Start walking, then walk long distances,
and walk the great trails.

In six months,
you will restore your body.

---

If you are large,
work up or extend your endurance.

Until it overwhelms your body,
and you begin to use up all the fat.

You can do it by jogging,
or dancing with dumbbells.

Jogging will give you powerful legs,
dancing with dumbbells gives you biceps, shoulders and six pack.

Until you get to the tipping point,
you will be just putting on muscle.

After the tipping point,
you will have enough muscle…

To exercise for so long,
that your body will not be able to hand on to the fat.

But you need to extend your endurance,
just like joggers do it.

Jog a litte, walk a litte,
jog some more, walk a litte less…

Until,
you can run the whole distance.

---

If you are skinny,
leave big bodybuilders alone – they have a lot on their plate.

Unless you are obese, don’t try to be like them,
for one, they want to look like you.

---

Instead build an athletic body,
put on a reasonable amount of muscle.

And that is accomplished,
not by lifting heavy.

But by lifting whatever you can,
for extended periods.

If you can lift something for too long,
you just increase the weight a little bit.

---

Walking into a gym, lifting heavy few times,
and hoping to get muscle, is irrational – it is too magical.

Especially when compared to, walking, dancing,
and twisting and turning with dumbbells for a couple of hours.

Just imagine two horses,
one lifts for a total of 5 minutes, the other three hours.

Which one, would you guess,
will have more and more useful muscles.

---

Workout maybe every day,
maybe every other day.

But you only skip two days in a row,
if you need to heal.

Synchronize your lifts with the beat of music,
and it will feel like 10 minutes.

---

Lifting,
is the simplest thing you can do.

Bodybuilding is so simple,
it is silly.

But don’t make it magical,
you have to lift a long time…

As long as joggers jog,
to get their muscle.

---

Three sets of ten reps,
with something stupid heavy.

Could slow down muscle deterioration,
of an already muscular person.

If all they had was 3 minutes,
to work out.

But that is not the reason,
why those muscles are there.

They are there because they,
messed with them for a long time.

They could do it faster,
with endurance workouts.

---

In the beginning,
you will have to use an interval timer.

Perhaps list for a minute,
rest for two or three.

And as you go,
you eliminate the rest, and extend the duration.

When you can lift for 30 or 45 minutes,
3 or maybe 5 pounds, that’s when the real exercise starts.

Extend your workout to one or two hours,
if you are large to three non-stop hours.

And you will see all the results you need,
protect your back, be healthy and live long.
