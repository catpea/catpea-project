Have you ever wished that there was some way to unlock your body,
a simple spell that activated healing and worked quickly and reliably?

Have you ever had back pain, the bad kind where you need to hydrate,
or the ruin your day kind where, part of you back will just annoying hurt?

Have you convinced yourself that you are just not young anymore,
and do you make noised that worry people that care about you?

Hokey Dancing,
the very opposite of the well choreographed and practiced dancing…

Can not only fix all such impossible and seemingly permanent problems,
but also prevent them from occurring, quite possibly ever.

Hokey dancing is dancing you make up on the spot,
stich together out of what you might have glanced once, somewhere.

And pulled out of this strange place where dancing,
seems like an instinct, and dance moves are not designed but uncovered.

Its incredible power is rooted in the fact, that at first you do the best you can,
but before you know it, somehow your body, uncoils.

And unbelievably, trull and deeply, sometimes in just a couple of months,
just becomes young again.

There is even a Sci-Fi aspect to this,
soon scientists will be able to roll back aging.

But they will never be able to create a shot,
that will energize that newly young body, the way dancing energizes it.

And,
with so little effort.

---

In some way,
Hokey Dancing is also a bit sad.


Precisely because how well Hokey Dancing works,
and how its un-believability will trick people away from trying it for long enough.

In my fitness self education I experienced both kinds of back pain,
where I just couldn't walk, at all, because of electrolyte imbalance.

And because I slept strange of stretched too far too soon,
at he gym.

The simple case of a stretched muscle, occurred to me just today,
it just took 25 minutes for my body to repair itself.

There is a fantastic shortcut I have for you, use a neoprene belt,
marketed for weight loss, this is only because it sells better.

Warming up your back, gives you a head start,
but also know any sports belt has a strong warming effect.

I wore a weight lifting belt for a couple of months this year,
and I could absolutely feel a good 20 or 30 minuted head start.

Where your back becomes even more flexible,
and all the aches are gone.

---

And please know, that music, will put you in a trance when you move to it,
so your time at the gym will pass faster, so as long as there are no distractions.

My three hour workouts,
very often feel like a pleasant 10 minute line dance.

Though I know it is not possible to convince you to Holey Dance if you are shy,
at least let me tell you that dance wasn’t invented to look pretty.

It is an early form of martial arts, practiced by the oldest tribes,
the same rejuvenating effect that I described here kept them fit.

They could fight and hunt,
throughout their entire lives.

Hokey dancing will get you started and ready for more, the new younger you, having experienced the unbelievable power of dance, will take it from there.

And believe you me, no matter how shy you are, you will never let it go,
because to give up dancing, is to surrender your youth.
