All the machines at the gym,
are for people who actually can’t lift dumbbells while dancing, for an hour.

Often, this is related to age,
but not just because “we all age”.

Making unwise choices, poverty,
and bad exercise plays what I think is a greater role.

After decades of not mainlining your body, you will need assistance,
bracing machines, benches, belts… so that you don’t crack anything.

As a young person, without injuries,
you never stop or, sit at the gym.

You do 1980 aerobics, with weights you can handle for 30 or 60 minutes,
until your body adapts so that you can lift more.

Muscles grow the fastest,
when you begin mixing in and lifting a heavier weight.

---

You are supposed to stand on the edge of what you can do,
until your body sees you as stressed, and grants you new muscle.

Thinking that your exercise,
is the new normal.

You have to stress your musculature,
not shut it down, or take it easy.

---

Do not start your exercise from the middle of the rack,
you are not ready to lift from there.

Having spent years lifting from there,
didn’t actually help you, as evidenced by the fact:

That you can’t lift more,
that you muscles don’t grow anymore.

The truth is,
you barely put the dumbbells down.

---

Lifting so heavy that you must stop, It is quite a curse,
as a result, you will only adapt once.

Because you are doing *something*,
even if that something is wrong.

Lifting wrong,
prevents your body from adapting, again.

Adapting again requires a tiny strategy,
start with an hour long workout with 3 pounds per hand.

Not a three minute workout that ends in,
“this does not do anything.”

But a 60 minute workout,
where you gently dance, to the beats of slow songs.

Conditioning your body to first mix in 5 pound dumbbells,
and then let them take over your exercise.

---

There is no workout without dance,
is you just stand still, doing bicep curls, you wok on two muscles.

When you start dancing with light dumbbells,
you work on all your muscles.

Proper posture, is a myth like, muscle failure,
lifting heavy posture or not, is too dangerous.

And ultimatley, it will give you minimal muscle after years of lifting,
that you could have gotten in 4 months with light, endurance bodybuilding.


---

When you lift too heavy,
you simply can’t lift for long enough to make much of a difference.

You have to start in the beginning of the rack with three pounds, for one hour,
for a few days, here you stretch, think about motion.

Get your slow playlist right,
close any and all rest gaps, pick up some fast songs, maybe.

And then you start mixing in five pounds,
and the first aim is to dance-lift non stop for 30 minutes.

And after a few weeks,
double your duration.

---

For those of you who can’t feel the challenge,
in lifting 5 pounds, you have to do it for longer than a few minutes.

You need to lift faster, and just before you fill like you cant lift,
you switch to another standing dumbbell exercise to rest and recover.

---

Beginning bodybuilding looks exactly like 1980 aerobics,
but unlike aerobics, when you body adapts, you light heaver.

Every dumbbell weight increase,
grows new muscle.

You have to communicate with your body,
and that means lifting whatever you can for one hours.

Eliminating rest, just like joggers do,
and keeping up with the beat of your music.

Country or Classical, when you start lifting heavier,
and euro-dance and disco, as your body adapts.

At which point,
you can begin mixing in a heavier dumbbell.

One nifty shortcut for gaining an hour’s worth of dumbbell endurance,
is slowly jogging, eliminating rest periods…

And then jogging with those 3 or 5 pound dumbbells,
once you have your non-stop hour.

---

There is no risk of injury here,
you furn fat, gain flexibility, get abdominal muscles, legs, and shoulders.

All just from beginning at the start,
and moving up as your body adapts to safely handle the stress.

Give yourself an hour of endurance and Lift light - but no so light you can lift more,
and never so heavy tha tyou must stop.
