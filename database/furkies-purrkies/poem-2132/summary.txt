This Is A True Story That Actually Did Happen

### CHAPTER ONE
# The Premise Nobody Asked For

The Intergalactic Union, which governs approximately 4.7 billion star systems and cannot agree on a standardized calendar, maintains a list of professions it considers "precious." This list includes poets, philosophers, and—rather predictably—astronomers.

The reason for this classification was recorded in Union Document 7,832,441-B, which states: *"Astronomers are to be protected at all costs, for they are the only beings in the known universe who will stare directly into the infinite void of existence, notice that it is staring back, and instead of screaming, will say 'Hmm, I should measure that.'"*

This made them invaluable.

It also made them somewhat concerning.

The planet Celdraxis, located in a region of space that humans would later describe as "probably over there somewhere," had produced more astronomers per capita than any other world in the Union. This was largely because Celdraxis had seventeen moons, four of which were visible during the day, and children there grew up asking questions like "Why is that one wobbling?" before they could properly walk.

One such child was [Vesto Slipher][1], from an early age, he kept intraicate notes on the moons all their doings.

This made him the perfect candidate for what the Union called a "Quiet Field Study"—which was bureaucratic terminology for "go somewhere boring and don't cause an incident."

The planet selected was Earth.

Earth had been on the Union's watch list for several centuries, primarily because its dominant species had developed the ability to look at stars while somehow maintaining the belief that they were the only ones doing so. This combination of curiosity and obliviousness made them fascinating subjects for study.

Also, they had excellent coffee, though they didn't know why.

### CHAPTER TWO
# The Worst Alias in the Universe

The Office of Interstellar Integration, which handled all matters of extraterrestrial cover identities, operated out of a building that existed in seventeen dimensions simultaneously. This made it very difficult to find the bathroom, but excellent for keeping secrets.

Agent Threnix-9, a being who resembled what would happen if a filing cabinet achieved enlightenment, was assigned ...

...e looking—at Mars, at the sky, at the spaces between stars where life might hide. He had been called obsessive, eccentric, and occasionally "that canal fellow" by people who thought they were being clever.

He had also been right.

"Earth is strange," he said finally.

"Agreed."

"The people are fascinating."

"Also agreed."

"The women—" Lowell raised his glass "—are to die for."

Emma, who had heard this toast before and who was technically also from Earth, rolled her eyes affectionately.

"And the astronomers?" Vesto asked.

Lowell laughed. It was the laugh of a man who had spent several centuries among the stars and still found joy in the question.

"The astronomers are the best part. We look at infinity and try to measure it. We stare into the void and take *notes*." He shook his head wonderingly. "Honestly, it's a miracle any of us are allowed to function in society."

"Speaking of functioning in society—" Vesto leaned back "—they never did change the alias policy."

"Still Melvin?"

"Still Melvin."

"That's criminal."

"I've said as much. Formally. Several times."

"And?"

"And they said it 'tested well with focus groups.'"

Lowell laughed again, and this time Vesto joined him, and the sound carried out over the lavender sea, up past the seventeen moons, and into the vast darkness of a universe that was—as Vesto had proven long ago—still expanding.

Somewhere out there, galaxies were moving away from each other at tremendous speeds.

Somewhere closer, two astronomers were moving toward dessert.

And somewhere in the archives of the Intergalactic Union, there was a file labeled "SLIPHER, VESTO (SEE ALSO: Melvin APP)" with a note attached that read: *Case closed. Subject returned home. Recommend: continued observation of Earth. Further recommend: aliases should probably be optional.*

The universe, as always, continued not to care.

But for one evening, on one planet, under seventeen moons that had no idea how important they were to the children who grew up asking questions about them—

Two men who had loved the stars sat together, and laughed, and agreed:

Earth was strange.

Humans were fascinating.

And aliases were, without question, absolutely the worst.
