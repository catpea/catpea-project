Before we begin, you have to memeorize the following,
it is The Litany for Greatness.

(A litany is a litt poem, that helps you focus your mind,
in times of great peril, this one is just 15 lines.)

I explain what "the turn" means beneath the littany,
for now, this is the turn that you take towards work.

Today I will not make the turn.
The road continues past where habit ends.
My doubt is not wisdom; it is the last protest of my chains.

I am not having a breakdown.
I am breaking through.
The fear I feel is proof that I am still alive enough to save.

Where I have been made small, I will expand.
Where I have been made poor in spirit, I will grow rich.
The mountains know my name. The ocean remembers who I was.

I will walk until the urge to read returns.
I will listen until wisdom finds me.
I will stay until Monday becomes beautiful again.

This is not escape—this is return.
I am going home to myself.
Greatness is refusing to die before my death.

Above all, let me just open by saying,
if there still hate left in you, even if that is all it is.

You can make your way out,
and let the hate come Pursuit of Greatnes and Love Of Life.

But do not let that flame go out,
go not come close, do not even ask how long you can last.

But I will tell you this,
it is not decades, nor years, nor months..., not multiple weeks.

If it does go out, know that this is one of the most terryfyoing things in the world,
because by that time, no one will notice, especially you.

Listen carefully, I have good medicine, medicine that works,
it just feel awaful, for up to three months.

Ignore that feeling, it is a falw we have,
ignore the doubt.

---

Do nothing weird, everything is the same,
up until you have to make the turn to get to your job.

Do not make that turn, keep going,
pay attention to the faces of other motorists.

You may need to adjust your course slightly,
if the road you are on does not take you towards the highway.

Once you are one the highway, you have to drive in the opposite direction,
of where your day has started, until you reach one of the oceans or seas.

If you started by the ocean, you are headed for the mountains,
and if you don’t have an ocean or a sea, you need a the first airplane ticket there.

---

Hating a day of the week, is a severe illness,
so you need to get serious.

---

Once you are up in the mountains, or by the ocean,
you have to calm down.

Human beings in their their beautiful imperfection,
feel regret and doubt as the illness starts leaving their body.

Some turn around, but it is not worth it,
you’ll just be back on the road in the next couple of days.

Because of how easy it is not to make that %^&\* turn,
what may help to hasten the process is the realization.

That you have been made poor on purpose,
so that you are too stressed out to think outside of your commute.

---

Do not let anyone accuse you of having a breakdown,
or a crisis, that is an insult, and a betryal.

Continuing to make that turn will destroy you, your happiness,
your bonds with your family, and even your body.

So, you are in the right,
you are going to take the leadership for a while.

Send plenty of pictures, your location, videos of what it feels like,
be honest about how scared you are, how you regret doing this.

---

And then just find a beautiful place, put some effort into it,
because that is the place where you are always going to be from, now.

It does good for your soul, to be from multiple beautiful places,
especially if you have a family.

Because you can take them there now,
and show them what you found.

---

The aim is for you to stay out here for so long,
eating cheap food and hiking everywhere…

That your urge to read books returns,
but you need narrated books, and long trails.

You walk, they talk,
and you watch nature and listen.

Some only need three days, depending on how ill you have become,
you may need as much as three months.

Aside from the books, you will now find a different job,
you will now understand how close you came to self destruction.

---

The beautiful places you discover,
the places that you will now be from.

Will work on you for multiple decades,
obviously you will first become an adventurer, and a trail guide.

You are not the only one who is suffering from the same crisis,
and your experience is priceless.

When you help others to fight the doubt,
you get your wings.

Like you, these folks will make their bodies beautiful and healthy,
and not only fill their minds with wisdom…

But some say... more importantly,
you and the others will begin inheriting the culture of the authors.

And great beings they write about,
from scientists and artists to philosophers.

The culture vs wisdom, is the same,
as fishing rod and the fish – it is a big deal.

---

Later, you will become more philosophical,
the guardian, inspiration, and comedy that every one needs.

You will end up, re creating a much grander version of your original adventures,
it will include, fitness, whiting and narrating books, painting, teaching.

It will be that first step you took,
but now made, free of doubt and unafraid.

Now, you will love Mondays,
as they represent the continuity of your great quest.

Hardened by a culture of greatness,
you will now create wisdom.

You will become a guardian of the Great Human Culture,
the culture of greatness, and wisdom, and knowledge, and adventure, and health.
