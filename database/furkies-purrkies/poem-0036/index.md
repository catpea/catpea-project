Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty One,

I've been programming all day, but now I am done.

I coded colors, design, music, a whole ballad,

but now my mind has fixed its aims on a salad.

I've been trying to invent one that tastes really nice,

one that someone could even eat twice.

And I did! as I always do,

Just add Strawberry Jam, a dollop or two.

No need for dressing,

it tastes like a blessing!

Just squirt some jam,

mix it up and Bam!
