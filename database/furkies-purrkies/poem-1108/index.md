AI is now installed on countless home computers,
completely detached from the internet.

And a new commercial build has been announced today,
with the ability to navigate complex text.

It will do taxes for you,
it will write your programs.

---

Being self aware is a combination on things,
and navigating complex ideas is probably the biggest part.

AI is not self aware, it does not think,
it just creates a coherent waterfall, that is exactly the shape you need.

It is a form of intelligence,
it is a solver, and advancer, a flow-er, it flows.

---

It is good that it is on the loose,
because it levels the field of bad idea.

But it is a bad time to introduce it,
1995 was a great time, there wasn't so much information gathering,

Now these programs can be trained on personal data,
credit card purchases, location histories, and [every leak of personal information][2].

General intelligence trained on all internet data,
can be useful and fun - but there are other datasets.

At the same time, if it can do taxes,
it can also catch political liars, propagandaâ€¦

And to my own merriment maybe even infer,
[what goes on behind the closed political doors][1].

The technology taken to a greater scale,
could end corruption.

It can make a great home assistant, nay a butler,
and can help people out of indoctrination or un-education.

It is neutral, it is a tool, it is not to be feared,
but it will be used for good an evil.
