Books are not meant to be just read,
they are meant to be heard.

And you __need to__ keep up with Philosophy and Adventure books,
and whatever authentic intellectuals hold in high esteem.

Narrated books, are free at the library, and you need them in your life,
as they will upgrade your culture and view of the world, your operating system.

Wherever you were born, it is very likely that you are making decisions,
without the full measure of knowledge that is owed to you.

You have been betrayed by mediocre teachers,
who really don’t care if you memorize or comprehend, because they just want to get paid.

The only thing that standardized education is good for,
is becoming an inauthentic teacher, in an ineffective school, an you don’t want that.

There is a whole world of knowledge owed to you,
you must seek out powerful and well narrated books…

And view them,
as your intellectual inheritance.

Starting life at zero, and climbing mountains that were already climbed,
will only have you repeating tired old mistakes.

Take care to inherit countless lifetimes of wisdom from books,
so that you may start where the greatest minds left off.

Please know, that fear, stress, overwork,
can combine to keep you from hearing even the best advice.

If you feel that you can’t even listen to books,
or it is all jumbled mess, then you need to take time off.

And saying that you can’t, just adds to the urgency,
start by buying an empty backpack and a tent.

Set it up in your house, play a nature video, to hear the cricket and bird song,
and slowly begin filling your backpack with adventure things.

You will regain he ability to weave long thought,
once you are walking in the woods, or through dunes.

Once you begin healing, you have to understand,
that you are really smart, don’t let schools trick you.

Neither the lectures, nor the grades were real,
you are just as capable of Greatness and Genius as all the greatest.

Standardized education can’t work,
because every human being has a different constellation of curiosities.

But you have to stop being stressed out and overworked,
and use books and adventure to give you new abilities.

Know that books will change everything,
they will help you see better.

But, programming, is the way to go,
and not just any kind of programming…

You need to focus on learning to build online platforms with payment processing,
the language for this is JavaScript as it runs both in the browser and on the server.

Here you can start launching tiny portable businesses,
that offer a service for which your users will pay a monthly subscription fee.

This is the age of early artificial intelligence,
open source text, audio, and image generation tools and models are everywhere.

All you need to do is come up with a product that AI will take care of for you,
and then wrap the whole in a membership platform.

[The best way to start learning programming is online video tutorials][1],
you can download them to your tablet, and bring them with you on your adventures.

Today, all it takes to grow all the way up and climb the highest of heights,
is berathaking books, that you take on tiny beautiful adventures with you.

With every book or lifetime of knowledge inherited,
you will have fewer worries, and more answers.
