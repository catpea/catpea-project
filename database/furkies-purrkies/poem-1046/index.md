This here is a poetic letter,
to remind all that the world can be better.

That we must never ponder a sad end,
but always aim to cheerfully transcend.

---

If you just roll with the ball,
then expect to fall.

But if you look to the Moon,
good changes will follow very soon.

---

If you let others push you around,
then you will never lift off the ground

If you aim for wisdom, knowledge, or art,
you will soon outgrow smart.

---

It is very hard to push away stress,
especially when it exists in excess.

But we are warriors tried and true,
and nothing can really stop you.

---

Right foot lest foot, as it goes,
and remember this is the life you chose.

It is beautiful to rise,
be it the moon or the skies.

---

To look down is a curse,
as down can only get worse.

Yes, there is a world down there,
but all you get is a free chair.

---

We are too beautiful to be that scared,
and our lives are far too sacred.

Do not let people keep you down,
even if you must leave your town.

---

Donâ€™t be part of the culture,
that does not nurture.

Your hands are not tied,
and the sky above you is world wide.

---

The human mind is too amazing,
to go through life without stargazing.

You are meant to become wise and farseeing,
you are meant to become a Great Being.

---

To start all you need is a 100 wise narrated-books,
they will push away sadness and all the crooks.

And all you have to do to find your first narrated book,
is go to the library and look.
