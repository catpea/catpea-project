Between A Rock And A Hard Place - How Presenting A Seemingly Moral False Reality Based On Ancient Abrahamic Religion As The Only Alternative To The Decadent Salon's Immorality Created Impotent, Infantile, Shallow Men Who Cannot Help But To Fail, And Where We Must Go Next

Prelude: A Caution to All Who Would Listen

Hear me, despite what destroyers would have you believe—
Ours is not a world where dog devours dog,
We are one humanity, one sacred family,
One wisdom shared, one future—noble, dignified.

When you find your brother fallen in the dust,
Or chance has placed you on the higher ground,
When fences show their gaps, when fools abound—
This is not your advantage, luck, or trick!

You are no miserable parasite,
Feeding on the weakness of your kin,
But noble! Dignified! A human being!
Born to lift, not feast upon the fallen.

Oh yes, some break your back with poverty,
Disguising cruelty as population's check,
Or worse—their fantasies of power and control—
But you are not their mouse, child, not their means!

You are never to lie, or cheat, or steal,
Nor tolerate in silence those who do.
And when you falter at this sacred wisdom—
As mortals must—you remain too noble for their schemes.

Each dawn presents the selfsame challenge, true,
Though from a higher summit than the last:
To rise, and rise, and rise yet more,
Until you stand among the great beings of the age.

Above all, conquest is dehumanizing and morally wrong,
the simple words "get a girlfriend" reveal a corruption of morals.
People aren't things to win, that is the language of the slavers,
a language that bespeaks of erasure of woman's autonomy.

Lo, I have seen the merchants in both temples—
Those who sell virtue and those who sell vice,
Both trading in the same debased currency:
Woman as object, as prize, as possession.

The preachers speak of Eve, the temptress-property,
The worldly speak of conquest and of winning,
Twin falsehoods from the same poisoned well,
Teaching boys to become not men, but tyrants small.

Behold the stunted soul who cannot see
His sister's mind, as sharp as any blade,
Her will, as fierce as mountain storm,
Her thoughts, that soar where his have never dared.

They gave her neither books nor freedom's air,
Then mocked her for the chains they themse...

...conscious glory of its creation,
Rising, ever rising, above all!

---

But soft—I hear the young ones asking, trembling,
"Where do we begin this mighty rising?"
Fear not, dear hearts, the path begins quite simply:
With boots upon your feet and sky above.

Take to the trails! The ancient paths are calling—
Ridge lines that teach you how to see afar,
Green meadows showing life's persistent beauty,
Rivers that whisper secrets as they flow.

But never walk alone into the wild—
Take faithful friends, for wisdom multiplies
When shared beneath the stars around a fire,
When struggled for together up the slope.

And in your pack, beside the bread and water,
Carry the greatest treasures ever made:
The books! The books! Those vessels of clear thought
From noble minds who blazed the trail before.

Imagine—Plato speaking by your campfire!
Newton explaining stars above your tent!
Mary Shelley haunting mountain passages!
Beethoven's notebooks read by rushing streams!

Procure yourself the simple, sacred tools:
A sturdy tent to be your moving castle,
A walking stick to test the ground ahead,
A sleeping bag—your cocoon for nightly dreams.

Then take the first step. Simply take the first step.
The second follows naturally from the first,
And soon you'll find you're miles from where you started,
Both outwardly in space and inwardly in soul.

Let every summit teach you about rising,
Let every valley show you about depth,
Let every storm instruct you in endurance,
Let every dawn reveal what you might yet become.

Continue thus, through seasons and through years,
Reading beneath the trees, thinking while you walk,
Until one day you'll find your true graduation—
Not given by any school, but earned through quest alone.

And then—ah then!—you'll know your contribution,
The unique gift you're meant to give mankind,
Whether mapping stars or healing bodies,
Building bridges or composing symphonies divine.

This is the education of the future:
Books and boots, ideas and wilderness combined,
Friends beside you, greatness calling forward,
The first step waiting for your courage to decide.

So pack your bag, young seeker! Dawn is breaking!
The trail extends beyond the visible ridge—
Where knowledge meets adventure, there you'll find
The power to lift humanity to stars.
