The beginning really does require a kind teacher,
but there one more step beyond, reading writing and arithmetic.

That step is programming,
a critical component for comprehending concepts beyond early stages of education.

Learning to write computer programs enables the student
to visualize, simulate, and create interactive games, to just play.

---

It is hard to understand what a cotangent is,
until the students reinvents it.

It is hard to see that speed of light is slow,
until the student makes a game where starships fight in realize.

And it is extremely enabling to be able to program on top of language models,
a comic book maker with AI graphics and even story line is a good example.

There is an extreme danger lurking here,
because Humanity has not yet learned that indoctrination is a kind of prison.

As early as possible, students must learn how to exit indoctrination,
so that each day of their life will be their own.

Right at the time abstract thinking comes into play,
the students must be helped to narrated books.

The ones that are held in high regard,
by all the world’s authentic intellectuals and true leaders, must he heard first.

---

The students must recognize that teachers, are teachers,
because they are nowhere near as good as world’s most brilliant great beings.

The teachers must only guide the students,
the clear thinking great beings who wrote the books, will do the talking.

An author who created meaningful works,
is a friend for life, as the students can return to their books.

While there is no real graduation as learning is life long,
and only gets more beautifully complex as we go.

There is something... an old tradition of setting off on an epic quest,
to extract more wisdom from challenging books, while facing nature, both within and without.

Taking to the great walking trails, The Appalachian Trail, The Pacific Crest Trail,
The Continental Divide, and their equivalents outside of US.

There is only so much we can learn by sitting in front of a computer,
or listening to narrated books at home.

We need thunder, and muddy boots, sausages on a stick,
and time away from cities.

So that we understand that we are nature on one end,
and far more than just humans, on the other.

Reading, writing, arithmetic, and programming,
the skills necessary to exit any and all indoctrination.

Comprehension of extremely abstract concepts by means of,
visualization, simulation, and play.

And thousands of narrated books,
that constitute a precious intellectual inheritance.

That will help them see that to grow up,
means to grow all the way up and become a great being.

Followed by even more books,
as the students learn camping and take to the great trails.

All set in a self directed and paced education-environment,
that is free, and free of grades, and cruelty, and ridicule, and punishment.

Is a good start that will help them see life as,
precious and meaningful.

Enabled by programming with the ability to create small side projects,
and later setting up multi-founder startups.

They won’t feel threatened by poverty,
and in their wisdom, they’ll take it from there.
