So first of all middle school life is super complicated,
and so is this story, it must therefore be short, and somewhat interesting.

I was a B student in third grade,
where I got thrown under the bus to hide fraud and became a C and later D.

In case you don’t know it teachers are faking education,
they are coercing you into memorization so you pass tests, and they get paid.

It is an easy con game, because until you are way older,
you don’t, know the difference between comprehension and memorization.

I refused to memorize formulas, and be a cog in anybody’s shit show,
and for that I got treated like trash and passed along.

When Poland got its first computers and Informatics classes,
the teacher accused me of cheating, but I was really programming.

I knew ZX BASIC from by Commodore 64, he just wanted basic INPUT,
and RND, to simulate rolling dice, and I added some extras.

And upset his stupid little grades-from-other-classes-copying,
fraudulent elitist mind, to the watchful eye and sick merriment of my bullies.

The bully later started a fight, and I tried to protect the little kid,
and all the kids fighting lied that I started the fight.

Shool psychologist showed up, took one look at me and believed me,
the first time I met a Valkyrie, but as others got in trouble…

The class still tuned against me, they already thought I was dumb,
several teachers made fun of me, because I would just refuse to memeorize.

And it was an easy thing to to for everyone,
we spent many years together as a class, they had no idea who I was, sad.

So I came up with a plan, become the youngest legionnaire,
and I would have to be a real cut throat at 15, and the use my money to come to US.

And [become a Stunt Man in Hollywood][1],
I got that from the Fall Guy TV show, it was an excellent plan.

However, just as I was getting ready to drop out,
my family moved to United States.

As I was learning english,
and getting over the fact that 10 cents is smaller than 5 cents,

My butterfly knife skills started fading away,
and I kind of mellowed out.

But, I still went skydiving, I overreact how badly it went,
I just have a natural skepticism towards instruments.

And I did purchase a discount cowboy had, as a proper stuntman should,
but getting a hat to fit is a form of art.

And the rains that my lovely cowboy hat saved me from,
made it a bit tight.

I am getting around to getting a new cowboy hat for the gym,
as the light above, really are kind of bright.

So I am still working towards my stuntman career,
I am now a fit junior-bodybuilder.

But you know, this whole programming thing,
apparently I got some good ideas in my mind, and a good eye for navigating complexity.

Before I start jumping from cars and buildings,
I feel I should finish programming, as it is incredibly fascinating.

So I guess in that regard, I haven't matured yet to become a serious Stunt Man,
but you know, I made good progress, somewhat.

I highly recommend it,
especially programming.

Now every short story has a moral, so that even those who dozed off,
still have a tidy take away.

Don’t pretend to learn to upease your teacher,
because that will only make you stupid, and probably dangerous.

A teacher who scares you into memorization is just a fraud,
who aim to turn you into a vegetable they can strip mine for paychecks.

Anybody who scares you into doing brainless things,
who interrupts your education, of frightens your joy away.

Of tries to force you into being other,
than you really are, is not a friend.

Our minds, and especially our creativity and imagination,
is very gentle, and requires great care.

If no one is helping you with that,
than you have to stand up for yourself.

Pretending to learn, so that the teachers get paid for a couple of semesters,
will ruin your mind for life.

Learn programming, you don’t have to become a programmer,
you just need an idea of what real education looks like.

So that you can make wiser and more dignified decisions,
and not just become a cog in an ineffective and education system.
