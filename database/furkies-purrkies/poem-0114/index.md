Nonfiction books are way to share wisdom,

some wisdom is in the form of advice, other you have to discover yourself.

Life is too precious, and we are far too intelligent not to inherit wisdom from books,

there is only one direction for us all, and that is towards Wisdom.

Growing up,

enlarges our worlds.

Wisdom, helps us see more roads in our Journeys,

roads that we would not have noticed without it.

---

How can we be sure if we are traveling on the path that does us justice,

if we can't see all the forks and roads ahead?

---

Let pursuit of wisdom bring you the light needed to enlighten your path,

to show you all the roads and many of the futures ahead.

Seek your own wisdom from many books that interest you,

that present a coherent path of self education.

Connect them in harmony,

make your road beautiful.
