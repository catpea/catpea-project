Learning And Growing; And, So The Philosopher In You Stirred
Saturday • May 3rd 2025 • 6:51:23 pm

Alexander The Great, had Aristotle to teach him,
you had teachers coercing you into memorization to fake your education.

Imagine your mind as an Operating System,
you are far behind on updates, and you don’t have an Admin to run them.

You will need adventure that opens your mind, which is to say hiking,
and narrated books, so that you can listen and more importantly re-listen to them.

You are not in any danger, but please be aware, that in corrupt nations,
education is denied on purpose, to make a vicious and desperate soldier.

You need you backpack, get one soon, get a tent as well,
the cheap ones are fine, they are just heavy, but it is a good start.

Your narrated books, must be first and foremost about Adventure,
and then Philosophy, but start with overviews of philosophy first.

Greeks are just too unusual, and will seem boring at first,
so you want books that skim over them, and avoid religion.

You want modern philosophy, but before everyone could say anything,
and pretend that it is important by just buying a Bestseller spot.

You are looking for the Noble Thinkers, not the Changelings,
the Changelings will destroy themselves by the end of the book, wasting your time.

They don’t understand what they are doing, so they won’t know,
when they contradict themselves, and as a result waste your time.

It is a terrible thing when you spend a couple of days with a thinker,
and you realize he thought he was talking about the opposite.

He didn’t perceive the suffering, he just wanted to be a hero,
and in the final chapter he goes ahead with his regrets and wishing.

Which point in the opposite direction of all his research,
showing that he didn’t understand anything.

So, get to the modern, but no so modern that you may as well be reading,
the works of your fake teacher’s incompetent parents.

But philosophy is second, because you must read adventure books,
about all the interesting places and expeditions.

No adventure great or small,
lacks in profound wisdom.

If you don’t know where to start, stat with Mt. Everest, listen about Australia,
and then American trails, Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide.

If you do get a tent, set it up tonight in the living room,
play some nature sounds, and listen to y...

...med not of conquering the stars, but of meeting them with open hands.

And still, you went further.

You began to study aging—not as decay, but as biology’s unfinished sentence. You wondered: could we cure it? Not to escape death, but to extend the time we have to learn, to love, to care for each other. You imagined a future where humans aged like trees—slowly, wisely, with grace.
You imagined children born not just on Earth, but on the moons of Jupiter. On the red dust of Mars. In the floating cities of Venus, where the clouds sing with electricity.

You dreamed of humans diverging across the Milky Way, adapting to new worlds, breathing underwater beneath alien oceans. We would still be us—recognizable in our laughter, in the way we sing to newborns, in the way we reach for one another in the dark.

You imagined libraries on every outpost. Art floating in space. Sculptures made of starlight. And even after we changed, we would remember—Earth, our first cradle. The scent of rain. The aching beauty of Chopin. The feel of another's hand.

But you also knew: none of this would matter if we did not change ourselves first.

And so you begun teaching. You taught that the true task of our time was not just survival—but transcendence with integrity. You told the young: “You are not passengers on this world. You are builders of its meaning.” You reminded them that a civilization capable of creating artificial intelligence must also learn how to listen, how to forgive, how to mourn the forests it has burned.

You were no longer just a person. You had become a link in the long light—a chain of beings reaching forward through time, sending not just technology, but wisdom across generations.

One day, someone will look back—perhaps from another star, perhaps in another body entirely—and they will not know your name. But they will be living a life you helped make possible. Because you dared to dream beyond yourself. Because you chose wisdom when it was easier to turn away. Because you walked, and walked, and walked—until you reached the place where the personal became inter-planetary.

And there, you stood.

A great being, not born—but made, by choice.

A guardian of what is sacred in us.

And a messenger, carrying the flame into the dark.
