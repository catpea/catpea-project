Speak Out To Inspire
Saturday • September 19th 2020 • 4:46:19 pm

Don't just try to be the change you hope to see,

it will take more, than just you and me.

You have to move an entire generation, or two,

and they need to be really touched so that they may follow you.

You have to speak out, to inspire,

send a Noble Message that everyone can hear and admire.

Fix schools, and end poverty, both at the same time,

this will help to prevent and stop most crime.

Reality is a fierce and powerful friend,

it is the only thing that will drive blindness to a permanent end.

Look decades into future, make your aims many, but small,

and baby step, by baby step go forward, to meet your goal.
