The notable test that I wasn't able to conduct is animating a pixel art character,
extracting frames, and using them as sprites in a little game.

I can’t search videos for pixel art, the website is playing all videos at once,
which is something my computer can’t handle, and I can’t afford the animation.

I think it would have worked, basically I would ask the leading AI animator,
for a cute pixel art sprite, and then make it walk to the other side of the screen.

I would be able to find all frames needed for programmatic animation,
and then I would make it animate it self based on keyboard arrow key presses.

More moving parts than usual, but I am very motivated, because,
complex animation of an intricate pixel art character is impossible for me.

---

Before my computer started smoking from all the videos playing at once,
I saw a pixel art bird flapping its wings, so that is pretty much confirmation.

---

The other part is pixel art backgrounds, they are always beautiful,
they are beautiful as is, animation is not needed.

But I think it would look even better with an animation cycle,
so the background would be a video.

AI animation is much broader,
then animating the usual little bit of something here in there by hand.

And as far as I can tell, AI animation is controlled by setting a start frame,
and an end frame, so the first animation would end in the middle of something.

And the second animation would start in the middle,
and have its end frame set as the start of the first animation.

Creating a forever loop, with an option to add more looping cycles,
that would play at random.

Pixel art can be so fascinating, that it is not uncommon,
to just stare at the background for a whole minute.

---

My other tests revolved around standards based programming,
WebComponents and Event Delegation rather than Frameworks.

And that was not a challenge even to simple AI,
that has obviously been told to stop often and ask the user what to do next.

To get a confirmation, and not in an annoying way,
it is just clever AI aided resource management.

Today’s test was particularly interesting,
at first I asked the AI:

To fuse an object proxy with chained/fluent notation,
and returning a bound function from  a constructor.

The result is astonishing, you can say:
hello.fluent.world with the option of passing arguments:

hello({times: 10}).fluent(“purr”).world({color: blue})

A list of things separated by dots, means that the first thin is an object,
the second thing, a property, which return the object.

To make the property optionally behave like a method,
that accepts arguments, is crazy, and magical, and not normal, at all.

I published the result under the name,
[malum][1], and it is indeed marvelous evil.

---

This was a two part test, and the second part resulted in a program,
I named: [eoten][2] , which are creatures with power of gods.

In this, test I asked my best AI to simply make malum genius,
brilliant, better, more powerful – I let it choose.

And it gave malum, programming functions,
that help to make use of the words separated by dots.

Basically allowing it to become a programming language,
a layer over websites, over SQL, and even application functions.

It lets you speak english to your computer program,
it lets you say things like:

if we are using memory, expire it in 10 minutes,
unless authenticated, authenticate the user, and then get user info.

Or SQL, like, select all from orders able joined with customers on id,
where order status is ending, soft by created field, limiting to 50 records.

---

All I am able to say, is stop pretending to learn for good grades,
and jump to learning programming, because you will ruin your future.

I know of no other words that can describe,
what AI generating eoten means.

The world hasn’t changed, it is new,
the AI is flawless, we are just using it wrong.
