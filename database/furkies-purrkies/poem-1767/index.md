Allow me to describe to you how to do it right,
as if we were at the gym.

First I would ask you to build up your endurance,
by power walking with dumbbells every day.

Once you shook off all the cob webs,
and got in to the mood of drinking water and warming up before exercise.

I would say: All you need is dumbbells, and you must never sit,
just do one standing dumbbell exercise after another.

Because different dumbbell exercises affect different muscle groups,
when you switch you start exercising a new muscle group while letting the other rest.

You always start in the beginning, if 5 pounds is too much then switch to 3,
al least to rest your arms a bit.

The rule to choosing the correct weight is as follows,
not so light that you can lift more, but not so heavy that you must stop.

At first you will not be able to lift non-stop, but that is only due to low endurance,
this is the same problem joggers suffer, and you have to solve it the same way.

Joggers know that it is not jogging unless it it non stop,
and they focus on eliminating rest periods first.

The [Couch to 5K][0] is an excellent example of how that is done,
I would describe the process as mathematical.

In fitness and bodybuilding, it maybe more convenient,
to use a free interval timer app, where you are in control and can make leaps.

At this point, we would select a starting song, to set the tempo to your lifting,
drums or pop beats help you enter a dance trance, or focus better.

And I would recommend an absolute starter song,
the prettiest and slowest song I know.

Kenji Kawai’s Cinema Symphony,
for [Ghost In The Shell][1].

Now that we have a song and an interval timer,
I would help you configure your interval timer.

By answering two questions, how many seconds can you lift for,
to Kenji Kawai’s Ghost In The Shell.

And how long long do you need to rest,
to lift for the same duration multiple times.

If you could lift 5 pounds for one minute to the slow beats,
and then need two minutes of rest.

I would configure your timer for 10 rounds of that,
meaning your workout would last 30 minutes.

And we are almost done, there is just one more thing to add,
because this is an intentionally weak workout for most people.

Here I would ask you, to either find a faster song, shorten your rest period,
add some light wrist weights, or maybe extend your workout duration.

This would show you, how you progress, as those are the things you must commonly adjust,
until you eliminate all rest, you are just training for fitness.

So elimination of rest should come first,
but finding a faster song, or playlist, is also a pretty good idea early on.

---

And just as soon as you can lift non stop, to just normal songs,
you then have to set your eye, on the next dumbbell weight.

Going up by 5 pounds is too much, 2.5 or 3 pounds is better,
so you should switch to 7.5 rather than 10.

This is, in my private opinion when your muscles grow the most,
when switching from a well worn weight, to the next one over.

---

Finally, please note how those who lift heavy, are stuck,
because they can’t lift heavier or longer.

But you can, and thus year after year, you will continue putting on muscle,
continue transforming your body.

Because you are actually giving your body time to adapt,
and list safe weights, nothing will stop you, nothing will hurt you.

You will have no problem working out multiple hours,
up to 5 days a week, until you meet your fitness goals.
