We are more than the muscles you can isolate on machines,
exercise that requires sitting or laying down, brings slow results.

You need a full body integrated workout,
that works all your muscles.

Again, one at a time will take forever,
all at once show results every couple of weeks.

And, because you are fire,
your exercise, must also look good, fierce and impressive.

And it has to be simple,
so that you don’t have to think about it.

In fact, it must use music in a way,
that warriors used music in their training.

They achieved dance trance by synchronizing motion and lifting,
to the drums, but also the drums cant be too fast.

If your songs are too fast, you will be forced to stop too much,
and that is really bad for your focus – find slow music.

Ok, I go to the gym very frequently,
and the first thing that hits me, is how hot it is in there.

I go from crisp air, that gives energy,
and keeps you from overheating.

To a hot heated area, from light, air conditioning,
and your own heat, unless I am moving the air around me barely moves.

It is a closed off area, confused, about fitness needs,
you just need a roof, cool breeze, a place where no one bothers you.

Stay away from overheating,
I don’t even want to say how cold the air must be.

---

But evey time I think about cooling off,
I just want to scream “Crank up the heat”, because I don’t like easy.

And then I imagine of the beautiful older women coming around,
with an expression of of pure rage yelling -

“If I wanted it that cold, I would have skipped this exercise shit,
and walked straight to the fu*king morgue.”

At which point, I just cheerfully calm down,
and focus on my exercise.

But listen, it is not just the heat, it is also the floors,
you are wearing rubber sole shoes, on what is very often, rubber mats.

These help to protect equipment,
sometimes you just grab your dumbbell wrong.

Unlike wood or tile, or vinyl,
rubber mat floor, just don’t get damaged.

But, that is also a deal breaker,
because rapid fitness, requires rave floors, concrete with some sand.

Grippy or hard to slide on floors,
will make your knees and ankles hurt.

And you need zero drop wide toe box shoes,
lifted heels (even a bit) give you the pump bump, a deformity.

---

Which brings us to a very simple explanation of what you need,
you need to search for “[ultimate shuffle dance tutorial][1]” videos.

It can’t be jogging, because you are not flexing enough,
and frankly, there is nothing else.

So you practice your moves, on concrete floor,
perhaps outside of the gym, in the morning when air is crisp.

And the moment you can dance for prolonged duration,
you grab onto 3 pound dumbbells.

And when yo ucan shuffle for an hour with 3 pound dumbells,
you go to 5 pounds, and keep moving up by 2.5 lb dumbells.

7.5lb is almost too much,
you will see your body changing.

And beyond seven, you will have to slow down,
in great part due to dumbbell inertia.

You you enter the bodybuilding zone,
less dancing, and more walking, will give you huge back and legs.

But 7.5 is great for a real challenge,
and 5lb dumbbells are just great for fast motion and toned body.

Look, I’ll be honest with you,
this is 1980’s Aerobics.

But you have to understand that dancing for multiple hours,
earns bodybuilders endurance.

So that they can rapidly develop their bodies,
you can dip into bodybuilding, it still takes months for big results.

But again, you need to hit every beat,
you need to dance with dumbells, Eurodance is the cats meow.

You have to keep cool to stay energized,
and your shoes need to slide on you dance surface.

And practice your moves, and almost as soon as you get them,
add dumbbells, so that you practice your moves with dumbbells.

---

Once you start getting tired, that means more sleep, wiser hydration,
and trailmix with protein powder.

---

The big deal about dancing with dumbbells,
aside from being able to tap into bodybuilding.

Is that this is a safe life long workout routine,
that protects you from harm, and helps you meditate to music.

So whether you are 18 or 80,
jitterbugging with dumbbells will keep you fit and healthy.
