Nobody noticed much at first,
I suppose no one - ever - does.

People forget that change,
is a natural occurrence.

This is not a preset world,
under perfect control.

First ideas that people,
didn’t pay attention to…

Begun influencing them,
they saw a strange pointless war.

Schools dropping tuition fees,
and fools, grow a brain.

There was a flurry of
medical breakthroughs.

Things that would take ages,
happened in months.

Programmers became,
even more powerful.

Bad Hackers pulled off,
wild crazy things.

And even evil men,
sped up their folly.

Just to self destruct,
that much sooner.

---

And censorship died,
it became impossible.

A 5GB model,
would run…

On a discarded office computer,
from a dump.

And was a very informative,
machine in deed.

---

All humanity needed,
was more narrated books.

But what it got,
was more than it could hope for.

---

Ineffective education,
became even more meaningless.

Why hoop jump,
why pay for nonsense.

When you don’t even need,
internet to learn programming.

When [a little ollama model][1],
was smarter than entire universities.

---

It was a natural change change,
it arose from the discovery of LLM.

And it quickly became,
a New Renaissance.


And it was unstoppable,
because young people got real answers.

They did not get graded,
they were were not shamed.

They were not forced to learn,
at a prefixed sequence.

---

They finally,
had their own private philosopher.

Uh, Old Socrates,
would have been heartbroken.

Had he known,
that it would take a machine.

To remind ourselves,
that to grow…

Is to grow all the way up,
until we each become a great being.

That it wasn't,
the great beings, who rose.

But even,
that had soon changed.

A Renaissance after all,
is just a better beginning.

And the best of us,
went right back to where it all begun.

Love of wisdom,
and the Philosophers.

That each of us, could now talk to,
and understand like a friend.
