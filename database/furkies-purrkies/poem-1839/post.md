You will achieve nothing by sitting on four machines for 10 minutes,
and lifting something you are not ready for, ten times, thrice.

Sets and reps is a hodge podge of lies, failed sales pitches, blivets,
and a bunch of misshapen old men pretending they KNOW how to doit.

---

Jogging reveals, very clearly,
how muscles grow.

And how swiftly,
your body adapts.

You only,
need to look at your calves.

---

In fact you should use jogging,
rather than interval timers.

Learn to slowly jog
non-stop for an hour.

And then start jogging
with three pound dumbbells.

---

Once you can handle thee pounds,
for one hour, without stopping.

Give it a few weeks,
and move up to five.

Then when you get used to five,
keep moving up.

7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20,
always moving up by no more than 2.5lb.

You will see results in weeks,
our bodies grow very quickly.

Plus the more muscle you have,
the faster you appear to grow.

---

Therefore, bodybuilding,
is an endurance activity.

That upon
completing the course, non stop.

Gets weighted down,
with the lightest weights.

---

Not so light that you can lift more,
not so heavy that you must stop.

This is, how you enter the keyhole,
where you continue moving.

---

Aside from the myth,
of sets and reps.

Four treacherous tricks,
will stand in your way.

At first you grow muscles,
no matter what you do.

Making you think,
that sets and reps are real.

---

Second, your lack of endurance,
will stop you fast.

Like a walker, or a jogger,
you must train to eliminate rest gaps.

Earning your endurance,
to move non stop for an hour.

---

If you can only lift 5lb for 1 minute,
measure how much you rest.

Enter the values,
into an interval timer.

And slowly shorten
the rest gaps.

This will give your body,
time to adapt.

---

The third trick,
is that lifting heavy feels hard.

But you are mostly,
just cutting off your circulation.

That does not do,
anything.

---

And fourth, the,
pain is temporary.

It only returns,
when you are inconsistent.

Of wait too long,
between visits to the gym.

The pain comes from
the sedimentary lifestyle.

It is not caused by the gym,
but by your body being in trouble.

---

Finally use slow music
to enter a dance trance.

Donâ€™t just listen,
but lift to the beat.

One beat up,
next beat down.

---

Stay,
in the keyhole.

Never lift so light,
that you can lift more.

And never so heavy,
that you must stop.

You are not yet ready for those weights,
you have to start in the begining.
