How To Grow Up Faster; Or, Thinking Outside Of The Box
Thursday • March 9th 2023 • 10:43:53 pm

Let us begin with a kind of conspiracy theory, you live in a box, some say a prison with invisible walls,
while it is emergent and not designed, it is enforced.

Your representatives assume that if they listen to you,
you will destabilize the box, so they protect it.

They’ll let you live the pretty silly fantasy of pursuit of happiness,
while ensuring that Real Education and Universal Basic Income, never pass.

They point to drug legalization, gangs, protests, and Brexit even,
and laugh among themselves saying…

If we let them have what they want,
they will destroy themselves and the country.

---

But that is a kind of madness, a confabulation,
broken groupthink, desire to feel superior, and an overwhelming amount of greed.

There is no better explanation for this madness,
of just looking at symptoms and making crap up to fit their preconceived notions.

Than an old lonesome quote, by dear Kurt Vonnegut:
“True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.”

Yup, the world leaders and representatives, are not grownups,
they are just aged nineteen-year-olds.

They didn't create the box, it emerged out of complexity and chaos,
they reinforce it, because they don’t know anything, but what they tell each other.

It is one of those, “forget what you’ve learned in college kid,
here is what really goes on, behind the closed doors”.

Resisting any and all change, goes really well with all this,
since they don’t know how to do anything, they don’t __have to__ do anything.

Let’s take a look at drug legalization for a moment, to contrast what they see,
with what really is going on.

Drug use is a mental disorder, not an incurable disease, but a disorder,
it is born from pain, poverty, fear, terror, homelessness isolation, loss,  hopelessnes.

A normal person wouldn't do drugs, they would see it,
as pissing into their brain, or worse.

An in deed a [famous rat experiment shows, that when the creatures are teared well, they stop seeking trash relief, and live][0].

But, the high school class that was runnig the country at the time,
criminalized it, for one it was a great way to get elected.

Eveyone you and I included can agree, that drug use is revolting, disgusting,

But by crimin...

...here, show that the kids are tough,
they sense the invisible prison walls, it is in our nature.

Of course, you have to view a couple of hundred videos,
that are related to this one.

And the my second recommendation has something more,
this video is not just about breaking out of invisible prisons…

But like in the many books you will encounter in your journeys,
this video helps you inherit not just wisdom…

But also some of the class of these great beings,
you befriend them, and in a way start thinking like them, thus enter their culture.

The often broken down in two parts, and [an update with Ayaan Hirsi Ali][3],
who wasn't able to join them in the first session.

[Four horsemen – Discussion featuring Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett.][2]

Lastly, I have a book recommendation by the funny Mr. Bill Bryson,
[A Short History Of Nearly Everything][5]

There are two reasons why this book is special, the opening, describes effects of ineffective education,
and the book it self, shows yo how a normal person learns.

My favorite part is the “Not Another Phylum” bit,
it got me burst out in laugher as I was jogging in Ann Arbor late at night.

Pondering schools coudn’t never afford to go to,
for one I coudn’t afford to pretend that memorization is education.

But the most illustrative part,
is Mr. Bryson visiting the Stromatolites in Australia.

That,
is how you learn.

And the book you write in the processes,
is your diploma.

If it so happens that you are the person that will fix schools,
know that more important than anything is travel.

Our brains need geographic motion,
preferably by foot as in case of the Triple Crown of Hiking, AT, PCT, and CDT.

But our world needs student exchange,
something that is necessary for world peace…

And becomes possible,
with a world wide Universal basic Income Program.

In the absence of teachers,
you must become a teacher.
