Real education,
it is about growing into a well integrated being.

A well-put-together mind, contradiction free,
full of content, authenticity, and well earned wisdom.

To clarify,
it is easy to flap copied wisdom in the air.

Today’s politicians get their campaign lies out of internet forums,
you may hear someone use words like indoctrination.

But they only uses them in a specific context,
showing they are only repeating a talking point.

They don’t know the word indoctrination,
is a disaster in it self.

They never earned the comprehension of that word,
just copied it being used in a context, that suits them.

---

This is very similar to ineffective education,
people know, but they don’t really know, they don’t comprehend.

---

This is how real education is not at all about having education,
I repeat: real education is not about education.

Real education is about content,
about having earned the things that we truly comprehend…

And about how the content of our character,
integrated within us as it grew.

---

To use another politician as example, they may hold up universal basic income,
as the reason why you should vote for them.

But they will only see it as promising you free money,
they won’t comprehend that an exit from poverty that will grant you serenity…

A critical precursor for learning,
and rising to pursuits of excellence.

---

Real education is about high density in-compressible content,
to what we hold dear.

That in turn makes us not just strong,
but unbreakable.

Finally, in the end,
what real knowledge all combines into…

Is a life well lived, adventure stories worth sharing,
and a legacy of wisdom that is worth keeping.

Real and profound education is deeply personal, and can never be standardized,
it about our very uniqueness, and about our life long quest for greatness.
