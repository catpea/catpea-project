First of all, troublemaking and making trouble,
are on opposite ends.

Troublemaking is a form of art,
and making trouble is probably just about being mean.

Allow me to show you how beautiful,
trouble making is.

Lets start with something simple,
just a moment ago I invented a powerful new snack.

It is just two ingredients,
Plenty of Cashews and a Handful of Pickled Jalapeño Slices.

It tastes like salt and vinegar chips should,
it is a sophisticated venture into a world of moist snacks like few other.

Now you have a problem,
because, you need to put both on your shopping list.

And put some effort,
into making the snack.

And, Is it as good as I say it is,
yes, it is fantastic, but you now have to taste it for yourself.

---

Now,
allow me to give you a big example.

I know you think, you won’t care,
but again, troublemaking is a form of art, part of it is making you care.

How about, if you could become young again,
more fit, at your age today, than you were, when you were a teenager.

Impossible, you would never even try it,
it would be too hard.

It is just walking,
and as your muscles adapt, you walk longer and faster.

Don’t worry about the scenery,
each day, will be more beautiful than the previous.

I ask you to watch five videos,
on the world biggest internet video site.

[What is the Appalachian Trail?][1],
by Virginia Is For Lovers.

[Our entire journey of completing the Appalachian Trail SOBO 2022][2],
by Appalachian Trail for Parkinson's Disease, they have even more viedeos.

And a playlist entitled [Triple Crown Trilogy][3],
by Homemade Wanderlust.

A good truble maker, won’t just show you things,
they will show you things you were missing in your life…

But, in the worst of way,
though not as a chore, but something you didn’t know you needed.

---

Personally I believe, that Troublemaker,
is just another name for Philosopher.

Socrates,
was called the gad fly after all, the father of philosophy was a troublemaker.

---

Now, you have a problem, and to solve it,
you will need a backpack, a tent that you can set up in your living room.

Maybe you can watch [A Walk In The Woods][4],
with Robert Redford and Nick Nolte, from within the tent.

If so,
say hello to Bula from me, what a character.

When you come back, once you are finished,
you can then start jogging, and then jogging with dumbbells.

Why limit yourself to being merely young-again-and-fit,
why not also get buff, a six pack is a lot easier than you think.

---

[Go forward, all the way][5],
it __will__ be even better than you can imagine, and you already know it.

And now,
you know, what troublemaking is.
