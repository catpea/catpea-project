I don’t like conspiracies, but I also don’t trust spoiled brats enough,
to dismiss the idea of them making us poor and maybe even uneducated on purpose.

Even if you believe that politicians are hard-working, caring and honest,
you still need a fallback plan to your education and career.

And programming is just the cutest thing in the world,
easy to learn from internet videos, and I say say, more colourful than art.

And programming, although being all about art,
is absolutely business friendly.

Allow me to demonstrate, few hours ago [someone posted][1],
about a silly little retro website project.

And I registered, and [I made a silly little web page][2],
like I used to do back in 1996.

Under their donate section,
you can see their currently unobtrusive scheme.

For $3 a month, you can get as much space,
as a whole github account, and you get perks.

10,000 “cute kitty tier” (as tey call it) members,
will result in $30,000 a month.

They will have plenty of other business ideas along the way,
and their costs are covered by adding a big hard-rive to their server.

And eventually creating another plan,
for high bandwidth users, it will surely cover their costs.

Programming such a thing does not take a lot,
you move in steps or layers and learn a lot along the way.

I recommend creating this thing with [JavaScript][3],
which is to say [node.js][4] or a similar server side engine.

This way you get to keep your front-end,
and back end in the same language.

And you just use [express.js][5], [passport][6],
ftp server module, and a [puppeteer based screenshot program][7].

It would take an entire Summer,
and at the very least make an incredible item on your portfolio.

So, even if it failed to get more than 10 sign-ups,
it would still be worth the while.

You are looking here ar server based architecture,
your bandwidth and co-location costs are a major weakness.

You are putting all your customers,
who already have computers, on one computer that you have to pay for.

Very silly idea,
unless you got cheap bandwidth and server cabinets.

---

I find that the old ideas, from when computers were a lot slower,
are far superior to the new stuff.

I do my development on a low powered single board computer,
to ensure that the code is performant.

This is very important, and I hope you adopt the same practice,
just get a cheap Raspberry PI, it comes with linux, and code editors.

So one of the biggest ideaas was distributing applications,
that are then installed on the user’s desktop.

That they can feel they own,
and they can back up with their files.

Here, you could be distributing an [electron based application][8],
that people can use for free, and offer paid plugins.

Perhaps even as a monthly subscription,
with the option of getting more credits like AI is doing.

So as long as you are respectful to your free users,
and not flash ads in the taks or meny bar...

This is very fair, they get good stuff for free,
and optional extras, is they can afford it.

Couple of years ago, I would give you some ideas,
HyperCard, VisualProgramming, User Interface Designer.

All very strategically sitting on the user’s desktop,
under their IP address allowing them to tie multiple services together.

Without anybody bothering you,
you just make the plug-ins now.

But in the age of AI,
Aside from visual programming being a clear winner….

You can ask the AI for small side project ideas,
until you find one that you like.

You can also innovate,
or pick up on broken dreams.

Innovation can be as simple as giing the entire internet access to a server,
where they can save information under a random UUID address.

They say HI to the server,
the server gives them a huge hexadecimal number.

And that is where they can save code,
so as long as it is valid and passes some tests.

You become a snippet server,
for a whole world of JavaScript programmers.

Everyone is your customer,
and if they donate $3/mo they get stats, dashboards and guarantees.

Picking up on broken dreams,
is waiting for a large company to make a mistake.

And creating a product,
that makes the correct decision.

You can host it, auction it off,
or simply sell a commercial license for those who want a beefy offering.

Programming is a pretty major way to express your business self,
and it is a massive step forward to crush your fear of poverty.

Whether it is there on purpose,
or not.

Start with [Node-RED][9], a visual programming environment,
move onto [p5.js][10] and then [Userscripts][11] that tweak websites.

And finally dive into [electron][8] and [node.js][4],
and this is something you wan to do with the aid of AI, as it is really good at JavaScript.

But, just look at internet videos first,
that is where you should really start.

Programming is so easy, that you can say it is just strings arrays, functions, ifs and loops,
it is just that you can make anything and everything…

So the world of programming,
is just infinitely large.
