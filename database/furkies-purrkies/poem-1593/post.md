You have to take care of three things,
your self, your education, and your future.

Lets start from the end,
you have to build a series of startups.

Until some of them start sticking,
and - well - make money.

Startups are hard when done wrong,
they are quite impossible is you just want the money.

A good startup idea is generating fresh AI music,
for gym rats that want a specific BPM and number of drops.

You will need to setup a website,
charge maybe $5 per silver membership.

Maybe upload to a video site,
to share, to advertise, or even avoid data fees.

This needs to be reliable,
daily, automated, interesting.

And above all, you are not allowed to work,
period.

Take a deep breath and listen,
manually operated companies are sus.

Your company must be operated by an AI,
The Hendrix Hotel from Altered Carbon is a neat example.

Times have changed,
most online services should be AI operated.

---

Don't be gloomy about this,
AI is your friend, you are meant to live in the future.

Don't let anybody slow you down,
don't let anybody drag you down.

The future is yours,
it belongs to you.

---

Now the second thing,
you can't cram, that is not education.

That is just theater,
you are not allowed to memorize without comprehension.

You are not going to be able,
to build anything that way.

---

You are many things,
and a Reader, Speaker, Writer, Arithmetician is the least of it.

But being able to real, speak, write, and do arithmetic,
helps to get to the next level.

It sucks earning numbers and letters,
but do you regret it today?

Such is the case with programming as well,
school and nerds just presented it as special.

But it is just how you control machines,
how you automate the AI to run your companies.

Living without being able to write computer programs,
is like living without knowing how to read and write.

It is a massive and unethical handicap,
and you must learn programming without complaint.

---

Learn the language of the web,
because whatever other language you start with first.

Will still call for learning JavaScript,
so that you can publish on the web.

But again, we living in the future,
with AI trick, such as transpilation, JavaScript is quite enough.

---

Just go to a books store and get a JavaScript Cookbook,
get a paper version, that you can bring with you everywhere.

If something confuses you,
ask the AI.

---

The rest of your education is found in narrated books,
as you take to long adventure trails.

Get serious about this, try going hiking this weeks,
next week for sure...

Pick a beautiful book,
and absorb it.

We are natural born story listeners,
pretty adventure and narrated books are something indescribable.

---

And now we arrive at the Third thing,
or the first problem.

If you fail to take care of your body,
you won't live long enough to enjoy the fruits of your inventions.

From now on and for the rest of you,
insanely long life.

You have to make running a 5K,
almost a daily thing in your life.

Use the Couch to 5K program,
to get started.

And make one of your earliest companies,
about an AI that generates music for jogging at all speeds.

You don't need to become a bodybuilder,
but you do have to live the life of an athlete.

Not another day,
today.

---

Finally, your aim must be to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

This is where you gain the ability to read people,
be it to see their lies, or help them compete their thoughts.

Becoming a great being,
is also a contract that you hold with your older self.

That is the one person you don't want to disappoint,
as their regrets will in some part unravel you.

---

Become an adventurer, a gad fly and a philosopher, an artist and designer,
a composer, and a programmer, a leader and a force of nature.

Aim to cater to each of your noblest curiosities,
and rise to no end in sight, and fathom more.
