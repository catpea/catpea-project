Captain's Log, Quarantine Serserge, Day Twenty Four,

I am ready to jump into my bed like a big dinosaur.

I am dressed, I am wearing my favorite workout clothes,

I stretched left and right, and fluffed up my pillows.

For tonight, I prepared, a Bill Bryson Auidobook I adore,

Even though I am already so sleepy that I could snore.

I will listen about the ,

about all the mysterious things and places we explored.

This is how I go to sleep every night,

the book will slowly play... until daylight.

I learned so much from online lectures and audio books,

that these days, I can focus on my good looks.

Oh, how I miss working out at the gym,

but I am still working hard to be slim.

Let us all be of good cheer,

quarantine will be over soon,

that is clear.
