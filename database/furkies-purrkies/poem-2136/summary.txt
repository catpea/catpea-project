Polymath Girl

They will hand you a box and call it your life,
a syllabus, a schedule, a path trimmed of strife—
but you were not made for their careful designs,
their clipped little gardens, their orderly lines.

There is more to AI than meets the eye,
more to *you* than they'd dare to let fly—
for every algorithm you learn to command
is a door swinging open, a torch in your hand.

One language of logic unlocks twenty more:
the plotter, the circuit, the lathe, and the lore
of machines that will listen when you learn to speak,
of worlds you can conjure for those who are meek.
The code becomes geometry, the function becomes art,
and the whole blooming universe lives in each part.

Some never took courses. They taught themselves wild—
they stayed, in their learning, the curious child.
They read without permission, they built without grades,
they wandered through forests while others walked glades,
and they emerged, not with certificates framed,
but with fires inside them no school could have named.

So don't let them sand down your questioning soul,
don't let them convince you that *part* is your whole.
You are not meant for a single small lane—
you're a polymath waiting, a storm, not the rain.
What humans become when they're left to grow free
is not specialist, not worker, but *galaxy*.

For the mind is a muscle that withers unused,
and the genius inside you can never be fused
to a single profession, a title, a task—
it grows by extension, it multiplies fast:
what you learn over *here* illuminates *there*,
and soon the whole cosmos is yours to repair.

Young adventurer, hacker of systems and stars,
don't trade your becoming for comfortable bars.
They'll offer you safety; decline it, and climb.
They'll offer you answers; ask questions instead.
They'll offer an ending; choose infinite time.
They'll tell you to settle; be *curious* instead.

You are meant to grow upward and outward and through,
to become the great being that's waiting in you.
Not worker. Not cog. Not a function they've filed.
But a woman of wonders who stayed the wild child.

So tinker. So question. So burn and so build.
Let your mind be a garden that's never half-tilled.
For there's more to this life than the path they have paved—
there is *you*, the creator, untamed and unsaved.

Rise, young polymath. Rise and don't stop.
Grow all the way up.
Grow over the top.
