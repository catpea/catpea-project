Terminus Six

The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.
—Alan Watts

PART ONE: THE TERMINUS

She stood at Chief Mountain on the ninth of September, the wind moving through the aspens like a whispered language she had learned to understand over seven thousand miles. The final cairn of the Continental Divide Trail rose before her—a modest stack of stones marking what the hiking community calls Terminus Six, the northern endpoint of the last great trail in the [Triple Crown][0]. Behind her lay the Appalachian, the Pacific Crest, years folded into footsteps, a life compressed and then expanded into something the philosophers once called eudaimonia—human flourishing, the full bloom of a realized existence. Her name was Sophia. She was thirty-one years old. She had just become one of approximately four hundred people to complete the Triple Crown of American hiking.

The granite peaks of Glacier National Park stretched southward in serrated ridges, catching the late afternoon light. To the north, the Canadian border dissolved into more wilderness—endless and indifferent. She sat down on a flat rock, removed her pack, and did something she had not done in all her years on the trail. She wept. Not from exhaustion or relief, but from the strange vertigo of completion, the disorientation of having arrived at a destination she had never truly believed in as a destination. The trails had taught her that arrival was an illusion, that all termini were merely points of continuation. But here she was. Terminus Six.

Erik Erikson, the developmental psychologist, wrote that the final stage of human maturity involves what he called ego integrity—the acceptance of one's life as something that had to be, the reconciliation of all one's contradictions into a coherent whole. The philosopher Jane Loevinger refined this further, describing a rare tenth stage of ego development she called the Integrated self—a person who has transcended internal conflicts, who cherishes individuality while recognizing the interconnectedness of all things, who holds opposites in creative tension without collapsing into paralysis or false synthesis. Such individuals, Loevinger noted, are exceedingly rare. Perhaps one in a hundred thousand.

...seven thousand miles but might find shorter paths to the same truths. She would advocate, in whatever way she could, for the wild places that had saved her life.

But mostly, she would continue to walk. Not necessarily on trails—life itself was a trail, if you approached it with attention and presence. Every step a choice, every day a summit or a shelter or a river crossing. The destination was never the point. The walking was the point. It had always been the walking.

The philosopher Martin Buber wrote of "I-Thou" encounters—moments when we meet another being not as an object to be used but as a presence to be encountered, a mystery to be revered. These encounters, Buber believed, were the substance of authentic life. They could happen with people, with nature, with works of art, in holy places like the termini. They required only attention, presence, the willingness to be changed by what we meet.
Sophia had spent seven thousand miles in I-Thou encounter with the world. She had met mountains and rivers, thunderstorms and sunrises, coyotes and bears and a thousand human beings walking the same direction. She had been changed by these meetings, made more herself through contact with what was not herself.

The parking lot came into view as the last light faded from the sky. Her friend's car was there, headlights on, waiting. Sophia paused at the edge of the trail, the boundary between wilderness and civilization, the threshold she had crossed so many times in so many directions.
She thought of all the people still trapped in the performance of contemporary life—the endless striving, the manufactured desires, the quiet desperation that Thoreau had diagnosed nearly two centuries ago. She could not save them. She could only offer what she had learned, and hope that some would hear.

The trail continued, she knew, even where there was no trail. The walking continued, even when you stood still. The journey continued, even at Terminus Six.

Especially at Terminus Six.

She stepped off the trail and walked toward the waiting car, carrying nothing but what she needed, prepared for everything that came next.
