This is the wrong question to ask,
a workout is not about what it looks like.

---

First of all, the workout is five days a week,
and you need to use music correctly.

You have to lift to it,
to enter a dance trance.

One bat up, next beat down,
you need songs that will support you.

They can’t be so fast,
that you must stop.

You will need playlists,
sorted by beats per minute.

---

Your first milestone,
is not how much you lift.

But how long you lift,
you need to lift for one hour, non stop.

And you should only use dumbbells,
it is a full body exercise.

It makes muscle isolation
and set and reps, look silly.

Sets and reps, are a myth,
based on appearance of early exercise.

And based on Bodybuilders showing off,
with TV cameras in their face.

It could have been a cameraman,
that asked someone to do 10 lifts,

Three sets,
from left, right and front.

Any wrong exercise,
will have a little bit of truth in it.

And fixing sets and reps,
results what I am descibing right now.

You must consider results,
it takes 10 or 20 years the wrong way.

And 12 months the correct way,
you should see results monthly.

And if you dial everything in,
especially your diet: weekly.

Your body will just grow,
that is what it does.

That is what it is for,
it is what it is good at.

---

So, once you can jog with dumbbells,
for about one hour.

You will have most of the endurance,
needed to lift them non stop at the gym.

If you don’t want to jog,
use an interval timer at the gym.

Just measure how long you lift your wrights for,
and how long you need to rest to do it again.

Enter the two values into the interval timer,
and configure number of rounds, to fill 30 or 60 minutes.

And then begin shortening your rest periods,
until you eliminate them completely.

This is the first milestone,
an hour’s worth of endurance.

---

Now you focus on lifting light,
but not so light that you can lift more.

And you must avoid lifting so heavy,
that you are forced to stop.

---

You can diet if you are large,
but this will make you tired.

Your body needs food, water,
and a good night sleep.

---

At first it will look like,
you lift light a lot.

But as you get into 20lb per hand,
those who briefly look at you.

Will see you lifting heavy,
and say to themselves.

I can lift twice that,
but they only lift 30 to 50 times.

But that will only cut them off,
from lifting heavier.

And more importantly,
from lifting for long enough.

You will be lifting,
thousands of times.

That could be where other myths come from,
as in what is in your water bottle.

A cola, is rather well formulated,
but mix something yourself, without the citric acid.

I drink root beer,
and it is the bit of sugar that helps the most.

Then after the gym, eat old school farmer meals,
they are configured for strength.

The meat, potato, vegetables, and juice,
helped a person work hard and keep healthy.

---

Finally, lifting to the beats of songs,
is called dancing.

To get your full body workout,
you will need to twist and flex and turn.

Be courageous, and dress courageously,
bodybuilding is a quest for health __and__ beauty.
