No More Homework, Mother!
Friday • August 15th 2025 • 9:38:05 pm

Hear me out, sit down,
because Homework only slows me down—
I need to learn programming,
I'm the smartest kid in town!

Those spelling tests are boring,
And math sheets make me frown,
When JavaScript has syntax
That turns my world around!

I don't need cursive writing,
When data types await,
With strings and bools and numbers,
Control flow is my fate!

Why practice multiplication
When callbacks call to me?
And promises are promising
What async/await can be!

Forget about my book report—
Map, filter, and reduce
Are functional and wonderful,
They turn my brain cells loose!

EventEmitter's calling,
With "once" so curious and neat,
While HTML's structure beckons
With attributes so sweet!

My teacher wants me coloring,
But CSS selectors shine,
The box model's like building blocks—
Flexbox and grid align!

Responsive design is magic,
It shrinks and grows with style,
While DOM manipulation
Makes elements dance and smile!

I'll select and modify things,
Make buttons click and pop,
Event handling's thrilling—
My learning just won't stop!

I'll make web pages beautiful,
With designs that make you "Wow!"
Browser add-ons? Easy peasy!
Node utilities? I know how!

Electron desktop apps await,
With windows I'll create,
Then bring in AI assistants—
Let THEM do homework late!

So Mother, please don't worry,
Though homework's on the floor,
I'm learning something better—
I'm programming evermore!

My brain is like a compiler,
My thoughts are loops that run,
While other kids play hopscotch,
I debug bugs for fun!

So cancel parent-teacher night,
Tell them I'm not behind—
I'm just a tiny genius
With a most peculiar mind!
