The idea of sets and reps, might have come from bodybuilders showing off,
on some TV show, they were not working out, they were showing off.

They were lifting their maximums a few times,
and then needed rest, because they cut off their circulation.

The idea spread, because when nobody knows how to do it right,
the liars will step in, and brainlessly lie “It is lie on TV” to look smart.

---

Sets and Reps are an incomplete idea,
as they do not include duration of your rest, which would have to get shorter.

It is a broken idea, because there is nothing in it,
to guard you against lifting too heavy for not long enough, cutting you off.

And it is an idea that only produces results once,
just like every other bad workout.

You get one single result,
because you move from couch to something.

But you can’t continue growing your muscles,
because lifting too heavy prevents you from lifting for long enough.

---

Please, stop it, sets and reps are a myth, a mistake,
an incomplete idea, and it can only hold you back.

By copying what everyone else is doing,
you are making others think it is a good idea.

But that is only,
how bad ideas spread.

Stop it,
stop deceiving yourself.

Find a free interval timer app, and begin with 5 pound dumbbells,
you only need standing dumbbell exercises, they constitute a fill body workout.

How long can you lift 5 pounds for to slow music in 110 BPM range?
Put that in your timer as your workout duration.

How long do you need to rest to do it again, several times?
that is your rest duration, that you must always aim to shorten.

Start with 10 or 15 rounds, and perform,
[Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1], [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2], [Overhead Shoulder Press][3]

One after another, letting each muscle group rest,
find [slower songs][4] if it is too much at first.

Fresh and crisp sonns are not optional,
as they put you in an important dance trance that will make time pass faster.

Your first aim is to eliminate all the rest periods with the lightest dumbbells,
and extend your workout to a full non-stop hour.

Your dumbbells should not be so light that you can lift more,
and not so heavy that you are forced to stop.

it is the same thing that joggers go, they first train for non-stop jogging,
as they initially run out of breath.

Once you can reliably lift 5 pound dumbbells non-stop for an hour,
speed up your music to 140 to burn fat, or go up by 2.5lb for more muscle.

If you move faster you burn fat, if you lift a tiny bit heavier you grow muscle,
if you can’t find 7.5lb dumbbells use 2.5lb wrist weights.

You will see results every week, and big changes each month,
precisely because you switched from weight based lifting to time based lifting.

You are now lifting for long enough,
and lift weights that challenge your entire body.

Please help others, do not compete with them,
tell them how it is done.

Bodybuilding is a life extension technique,
it repairs our bodies and makes us younger.
