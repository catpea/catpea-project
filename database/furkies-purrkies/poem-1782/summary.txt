Going Buff
Thursday • January 16th 2025 • 11:53:37 pm

It seems that music is at the center of bodybuilding,
but it and several other concerns have to be dialed in quite right.

And bodybuilding it self appears to be much different,
from what everyone is doing.

You only need dumbbells, and you need to lift non-stop,
pausing for three or so seconds every couple of minutes.

There is no lifting heavy, as that only cuts off circulation,
and sets and reps are just a myth.

Just like joggers everyone needs to stop at first,
and just like joggers, those rest times must be eliminated.

So you start on a platform of non-stop 5 pound dumbells,
for one hour to slow songs.

And from here you can add more hours, go up by a couple of pounds,
or speed up your songs.

---

You need to learn to control the tempo of your songs,
you can use Audacity, ffmpeg-atempo filter, and AI.

---

If your songs are too slow, the workout will feel flimsy,
if they are too fast, you will need to stop too frequently.

Aside from dictating a stable tempo you can slowly adjust,
as your body adapts and grows muscle.

Music helps with focus, there is no workout without it,
distractions are a disaster for bodybuilding.

A lot of the reason as to why it is just standing dumbbell exercises,
is focus, switching between equipment will also ruin a workout.

And the songs must always be fresh, as they have a kind of energy,
and you must always hit every beat, as that induces the dance trance.

It is actually one beat for lifting up, and one for lowering,
a 120 BPM song, will have you lift your dumbbells 60 times a minute.

---

Workout energy can only come from slow to digest food,
oatmeal does not seem to work as well as trailmix and noodles.

---

Dumbbells are a simple thing, so it is only,
[Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1], [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2], and [Overhead Shoulder Press][3].

And you cycle between these non stop,
letting the different muscle groups rest.

You can use an interval timer,
to eliminate the initial stopping.


When configuring it, you have to ask,
how long can I cycle 5 pound dumbbells for.

And how long do I need to rest,
to do it again, several times over, to fill an entire hour.

---

Five pound dumbbells, could be too light,
and they certainly become too light in a couple of months.

So you lift light, but not so light, that you can lift more,
but not so heavy, that you are forced to stop for long.

---

A workout is a focused multiplex of the above,
adjusted to challenge your body, and keep it challenged.

Just the moment you adapt, you adjust music, weight or duration,
to put the challenge back on the edge.
