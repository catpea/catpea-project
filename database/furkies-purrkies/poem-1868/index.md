Preface,

In the modern gym we are taught to lift heavy,
but that means we can’t lift for long enough to adapt.

We aren’t lifting for long enough,
because the middle of rack where we all start is too heavy.

And thus we can’t hope to ever lift heavier, and for even longer,
to both signal our body and give it time to grow.

Learn to move, dance or jog for an hour, with three pound dumbbells,
an only then go higher and by no more than 2.5 pounds.

The results occur weekly, you decide how far you want to go,
or whether you want to lift heavier for muscle, or longer for a lean athleltic body.

Without further adu,
Warrior Fit.

Everybody knows about the corn stalk,
how young warriors would receive a seed.

And train to jump over the resulting plant,
as it grew higher and higher destined to outgrow them.

And everybody quickly forgets,
this precious secret to fitness and bodybuilding.

The moment, they step into a gym,
and discover all the opportunities for ceaselessly sitting.

---

A gym is a holly place, a sacredness place,
where no one stops to rest.

Or even has time,
to look in the mirror.

A fat cat enters,
a beautiful warrior leaves.

---

A self renewing, adaptive biological body,
is the most powerful vessel for the mind.

It shouldn't need instruction,
you should remember from childhood…

That if you run a little bit,
you will soon be able to run more.

You warrior body can adapt to great feats,
far beyond what mere athletes can imagine.

---

You start slow, like a snail,
and expand your exercise outward in an arc, like its shell.

You must be precise, because your body is precise,
you must use landmarks, you must time yourself.

Use an interval timer, or an Open Source app,
use pen, pencil, watch calculator.

And at first,
once you can very slowly run straight through.

Without stopping, of feeling too tired,
you then begin running with with dumbbells.

When you can slowly run with 3 pounds per hand,
you begin checking if it is yet possible to run with 5.

Like the cornstalk grows,
and the warriors try to jump over it.

You must aim higher and higher,
7.5 pounds, 10 pounds, maybe, 12.5, 15, 17.5.

And your body will slowly adapt,
sustained duration is more important than the heavy weights.

Not so light that you can lift more,
but not so heavy that you must stop.

Double your slow jog duration if you are heavy,
if you need a gym, go twist and turn at the gym.

Make the workout harder and longer,
than slowly jogging with dumbbells.

Use music to induce a dance trance,
by lifting to the beats.

One beat up,
next beat down.

Focus on your workout,
give your body time to adapt.

Becoming a warrior,
is your family’s oldest tradition.

But you must move daily, mathematically,
and give your body time to adapt before you lift heavier.
