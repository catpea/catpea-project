Gerbil Trouble On The Double
Sunday • February 2nd 2025 • 11:53:51 pm

The Michigan geese do not play,
and they have returned on Friday.

I am pretty sure they did know,
is that it would start to snow.

I can’t tell yet,
if they are upset.

But Punxsutawney Phil,
needs to chill.

More winter is not what we need,
in deed, in deed.

---

Because of all these cold spells,
I had an incident with the squirrels.

One came up to me so close,
that I completely froze.

It is one of my biggest fears,
that a bouncy one will grab me my the ears.

And bite my nose.
so I quite literally, froze.

---

Once such an even takes place,
you probably can’t ever clean your face.

You just don’t know where a squirrel has been,
or if they actually ever, lick themselves clean.

I fear,
because I hold cleanliness dear.

--

But, all of a sudden she whipped out an acorn,
and held it up like it was her new born.

We stood there for a while,
until I put on a fake little smile.

And she hopped away,
I am grateful she didn’t hurt me to this day.

But I completely understood,
that she was asking me for food.

I had a peanut or two,
but I knew that wouldn't do.

So I went to the store,
to see if I can get some more.

I wanted to get some acorns for her,
like a proper Squirrel whisperer.

But got scared that the cashier,
would say “We have them in the back, Dear.”

But instead of leading me to the goods,
she’d just show me the back woods.

People get *clever* with me like that,
but then leave weather up to a rat.

It is pretty clear that the groundhog,
only holds sleeping dear.

Meanwhile the rest of us are so cold,
no gerbil should ever put Spring on hold.

Lets just put our heads together,
and stop putting gerbils in charge of weather.

---

What are the geese to do,
they thought the winter was through.

But it got cold,
anew.
