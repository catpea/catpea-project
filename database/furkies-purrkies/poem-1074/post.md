Above all, books are not meant to be read but heard,
the same way that sheet music must be played in order to be fully understood.

To properly understand a book you need the narrated version,
these are called Audio Books.

Books are your intellectual inheritance, and while you are learning,
you should not pay for them, please use the library.

Now, if you are like everyone else,
you are too busy, there is too much chaos and noise.

You are correct to assume,
you won’t be able to inherit from books in this state.

Just because you can work extra hard,
or do something with great might.

It does not mean you should do it,
because when you push your self too hard.

You lose the ability to learn,
at your normal pace.

Stress will cancel your intellectual inheritance,
it will nullify your curiosity, and prevent you from growing up.

If there is nothing to prevent you from, throwing yourself into work,
then know there is such a thing as intellectual hygiene.

You have to take care of your mind,
when you center yourself, you will then be able to fully inherit from wise books.

I know what you are saying, “easier said than done”,
and there are two reasons for that

One that we can deal with, making choices in life, out of sequence,
where consequences build up, and things get complex; but that’s life.

If you are young, prevent yourself from making choices,
that will make your life mode difficult, books will help you with that too.

The second reason is working a job, that is sweetly and respectfully,
destroying you, your personality, your health, your mind, for paychecks.

The reason why we need paychecks is because politicians are just actors,
who are incapable of creating a stable basic income programme.

When complexity of life, which is to say, living life,
meets a toxic career, you get cut off from intellectual hygiene.

The Appalachian Trail (or similar), is your medicine, it is a six month expedition,
from Georgia to Maine, that will help you regain your mental health.

Be warned, the first few days on the trail are ultra toxic,
doubt like you’ve never had before will try to get you back to work.

Fight it, this is a fight for your mind, for your mental health,
and a fight for your life.

You can ask your elder self what they expect of you,
just, ask them what their regrets are.

Your intellectual inheritance,
is several thousands authentic honest non-fiction books, in size.

You need so many to both, get a feel for what is real,
and keep up to day with all the world’s great beings.

This is how you can tell a well to do political actor,
from an actual leader and thinker that deserves to become an authority figure.

The books,
are your life line to reality.

They are how you grow up - instead of just aging - and most importantly,
they are your only way to grow all the way up, until you become a great being.
