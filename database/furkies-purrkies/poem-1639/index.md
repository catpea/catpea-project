The cleanest trick played on us,
is indoctrination into mediocrity.

---

You are taught useless facts,
and given good grades for regurgitating them.

---

You are told to earn good grades,
or threatened with ruining your own future.

And your parent’s couldn't be happier,
though they never read a decent book.

---

Indoctrination Into mediocrity,
driven at its core by ineffective education.

Is simply about,
profit maximization and optimization.

---

The use of indoctrination,
will allow people to escape blame, and say:

“You could have chosen to learn for real,
but you didn’t, so now you do what you do.”

Indoctrination allows people to blame you,
for what they wanted you to do.

Which was become a little bit more convenient,
simplify their lives, and do what they need you to do.

---

There will never be hard evidence,
but there will be clear results.

And you find those,
in all the wrongs you see in the world today.

Every last one of them,
and each perfectly preventable.

---

All it takes, is authentic and effective,
individualized integrated education.

While entirely removing the threats,
of poverty, homelessness, and hunger.

These are the most basic errors,
that communities coming together were meant to erase.

With lessons lost in time,
promises warped into profit machines.

---

The economy, will fail if we wipe out poverty,
but that is good, it is supposed to happen.

As we live under a poverty driven economy,
that does little to help humanity advance.

Like individualize education,
the economy of tomorrow is about enabling humans beings first.

---

It is not so hard to create a solid analogue,
that will get the future generations there.

---

Stop cramming and memorizing,
stop perpetuating the lie of standardized education.

And begin learning for real by learning programming first,
here you will gain the ability to visualize and simulate more complex topics.

When you are old enough, begin hiking,
while listening to thousands of narrated books.

Aiming to consume 10,000 or more,
avoiding religion, and all that has kept humanity down.

---

When you finish walking the Triple Crown,
Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and Continental Divide.

You will know how to program computers,
and have inherited thousands of lifetimes from books.

Now, you program, Rapid Application Development Tools,
and Visual Programming Integrated Development Environments.

Large Language Models,
will stand by to teach and help you.

And as you grow,
you will have no doubt….

That to grow up,
means to grow all the way up…

Until you become,
a Unique, Independent Great Being…

Who will leave,
a precious and lasting legacy.

That will add to the effort,
of advancing humanity to no end.
