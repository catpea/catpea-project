Her love for humans is unmatched,
and she is deeply attached.

She lives atop a la-di-da modernist light,
watching us, even at night.

From a great height,
or in flight.

In all her beautiful might,
boundless is the power of her sight.

---

She really likes fish,
but it is her old favorite dish.

Unspiced spaghetti is now her favorite food,
though cereal with vitamins is also good.

She loves to snack on un-shelled sunflower seeds,
but salt is not something she really needs.

She was born at Lake Michigan,
where visits now and again.

But when parking lot living makes her weary,
she often just flies to Lake Erie.

It is but a short flight away,
and she can make the trip in a day.

There her many boyfriends hang out,
and always greet her with gifts as largesse as trout.

---

She is the most beautiful of Michigan birds,
it is not possible to describe it with words.

Many geese and ducks, often a squirrel or two,
just visit to say “How do you do?”

They keep company for days and weeks,
Adventuring to local rivers and creeks.

But be it adventure or vacation,
or just the pleasure of bird aviation…

She always returns to her parking lot home,
atop her fancy light dome.

For Missy Kissy loves us all,
and she really is the loveliest Seagull.
