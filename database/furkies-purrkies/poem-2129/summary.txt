# A New Year's Address to the World

## On Greatness, and the Crime of Smallness

---

My fellow human beings—not citizens of this nation or that, not consumers, not voters, not "demographics" to be analyzed and manipulated—but *human beings*, heirs to ten thousand years of struggle, sacrifice, and the slow, aching reach toward something higher:

I speak to you tonight as a voice—one voice among billions—that refuses to be silent while the very meaning of human life is hollowed out and sold back to us as contentment.

## I. On the Metrics of Misery

We are told the world is being measured.

The World Happiness Report ranks nations by their satisfaction. The Doomsday Clock ticks toward midnight, warning us of annihilation. Economists chart our gross domestic product, our consumer confidence, our quarterly growth.

But I ask you: *Who is measuring our greatness?*

Who is asking whether this generation will produce its Aristotle, its Ayn Rand, its Marie Curie? Who is counting the geniuses we have buried in poverty before they could speak? Who is accounting for the philosophers we have turned into file clerks, the poets we have made into addicts, the revolutionaries of the spirit we have numbed with screens and noise and the endless repetition of *buy, consume, obey, be small*?

The Doomsday Clock tells us we may die. It does not ask whether we have *lived*.

The Happiness Report tells us we are satisfied. It does not ask whether we have become *worthy* of satisfaction.

And so I say to you: these metrics are not merely inadequate. They are *obscene*. They measure the temperature of a corpse and call it health. They count the chains and call them bracelets.

A human being is not born to be *satisfied*. A human being is born to be *great*.

## II. On the Hollow Words of Small Men

We have heard our leaders speak.

We have heard them invoke courage in speeches written by committees, delivered between fundraisers, forgotten by morning. We have heard a world leader—a grown man, charged with the fate of millions—say that "stories of the triumph of courage over adversity give me hope."

*Stories* give him hope.

Meanwhile, he signs the orders. Meanwhile, young men are fitted for uniforms. Meanwhile, the machinery of ...

...n he became president. Your years are not a burden; they are a treasury. Share what you have learned.*

I call to the poor, who have been told they lack the resources for greatness: *Poverty is not your failure; it is theirs. Every obstacle placed before you is evidence of how much they fear your rising. You were not born to serve their economy. You were born to outgrow it.*

I call to the politicians, the legislators, the executives—yes, even to you: *Remember what you were supposed to be. Not a manager of decline. Not a servant of donors. But a servant of the people—a philosopher in action, a steward of human potential. History remembers few presidents, few prime ministers. But it remembers every leader who lifted humanity higher. You still have time. Choose to be remembered.*

And I call to everyone who hears these words, in whatever nation, in whatever circumstance, in whatever state of hope or despair:

*You are not meant to be small.*

You are not meant to be satisfied with satisfaction. You are not meant to measure your life by the metrics of those who profit from your smallness. You are not a consumer, a demographic, a data point, a voter to be engineered.

You are a human being—heir to Prometheus who stole fire from the gods, heir to every rebel and saint and genius who refused to accept the world as it was, heir to ten billion ancestors who survived against all odds so that you could be here, now, reading these words.

The greatness they carried lives in you.

## VII. A Final Word

The words have been spoken. The call has been made. And somewhere, someone is hearing it.

Not everyone will answer. Most will return to their screens, their distractions, their managed lives. The small men will continue to rule, for a time. The machinery of ignorance will grind on, for a time.

But *not forever*.

Because ideas cannot be killed. Because the truth, once spoken, echoes. Because somewhere, in some forgotten classroom, in some impoverished home, in some prison cell, in some corner of the world the powerful have written off—someone is waking up.

Someone is deciding to be great.

*"They tried to bury us. They did not know we were seeds."*
— Mexican proverb

**A Blessed New Year to all who choose to grow.**
