There is a million ways to live life, but…
there are fundamentals that cannot be altered.

Ms. Rand would encourage us,
to always evaluate, always judge, always think, and keep a check on our premises.

Mr Sagan would remind us that we are born of the stars,
stardust.

And Mr Gell-Mann, that we have Emerged from chaos,
and fundamental principles of physics and chemistry.

Dr. King Junior, beautifully crowned the words,
Content of Character.

And Mr. Thoreau, does not mince words, stating that,
we don not want to find out come our final days, that we never lived at all.

These are the true leaders of our past,
Humanity in its lack of education, rarely gets things right, for long.

I leave it up to your generation to determine the urgency,
with which you should repair education…

That is to say,
make it effective, for a change.

You will see, eventually, that brilliant ideas shine,
but they always corrode, and fade away.

This is why I say, that there is a million ways to live,
but, we have great responsibilities.

One of which, is brilliance,
you are charged with kindling fire to put all the fools to shame.

These ideas must spread,
and in turn help to light other ideas.

So that, the brilliance of your generations,
can overwhelm the natural tendency for good things to fade.

---

Likewise, it is not enough for you to just listen and read to your books,
you have to keep those flames alive.

You need not look farther than the previous generation,
get a journal, a proper typewriter, vintage-cassette-recorder.

And make sure that the gen ration that is to follow,
will find meaning in your works.

So that they too can rise to your shoulders,
and become giants in their own right.
