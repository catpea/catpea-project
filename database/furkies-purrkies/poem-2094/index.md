The painters call it a sitting,
the musicians call it a session.

The session are your afternoons,
with Artificial Intelligence.

It creates complete enough applications today,
for you to need to start making chicken noises in the AI world.

Don’t delay, because falling behind,
is a huge curse.

Imagine an older person today,
not knowing how to use a web browser.

This is what is going to happen top you,
if you ignore programming with artificial intelligence.

It is a very real danger,
that you will ruin your future.

By cutting yourself off,
from becoming an independent creator.

---

Nobody knows what is going on,
how all of this is possible.

But let me give you three headlines,
from outside of the world of programming.

To show you where we are,
today.

---

“AI accelerates scientific research across biology, math and medicine by months-to-minutes”

“AI startup uses machine learning to custom-design programmable proteins for drug development and agriculture”

“AI trained on bacterial genomes generates novel proteins by learning gene patterns, producing functional antitoxins never seen before when prompted with toxin sequences”

All headlines have color added to them,
but this is not science fiction anymore.

Before you know it you will either stop aging,
or have access to rejuvenation therapies.

The world is new,
your outlook on life needs to be new.

Pretending to learn just to keep your GPA up,
is now a danger to your future.

You have to learn for real,
and there is no better start than The Sessions.

---

You have to understand, that even today,
every afternoon represents a new tool of web application.

If you spend three afternoons,
you are building something truly special.

If you have more than four sessions in you,
you are changing the world.

---

It used to be, that it would take one year,
for one programmer to create one web application.

Now it is just one afternoon session, AND YOU,
you have absolutely no idea how powerful you are.


Based on what I have learned this week,
the GPA chase is now endangering your future.

It is pushing you away from,
The Sessions, from imagining programs

And that is pushing you into poverty,
and under a stranger’s paycheck and thus control.

I repeat this is not an exaggeration,
this is a real alert.

I wrote several program over the weekend,
by talking to AI, and telling it about the little bugs it made.

To my shock, the AI understood everything,
it fixed every bug I found.

And I didn’t need to give it technical descriptions,
I just told it what was broken.

Described where things were wrong,
and it fixed them.

And please understand,
it fixed them better than searching the internet would.

The internet can’t bring you the answers,
that a thinking machine does.

That is how you recognize,
that the intelligence is real.

Few weeks ago I was still reading about,
how AI rewrote everything to beautifully to perfection.

And it beautifully didn’t work,
that is no longer the case.

It makes the correct choices,
avoids or fixes every mistake it can see.

And whatever is too confusing,
it uses your eyes and description to catch it.

Start creating web applications with AI,
even if just to sharpen your mind.

Once you become serious about your programming,
begin making tools, that lift you up above your competition.

It is like building a pyramid,
you keep going up and up, to a height no one has been on before.

And there you create the applications,
that make all the difference.

Begin your sessions immediately,
the younger you are the more important this is.

Ask about litte web applicans you would like to see,
and then how they work and why.

Don't wait for anybody's approval,
the older people are the less likey they can grasp the gravity of this situation.

The AI, the copy of our intelligence,
it showing clear signs of having outthought the internet.

You are in chage of your own, future,
the others when they fail you just ask "How were we supposed to know?"

Take responsibility for you own authentic educaion,
and may you soon understand that you are mean to grow all the way up, and become a great being.
