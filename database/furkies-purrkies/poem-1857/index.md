The idea-and-ideal of the Lady and Gentleman,
was like a computer program for our minds.

It was a toolkit for thinking and learning,
that came close to destroying liars.

It was nothing like a panic, or a hunt,
it was a gateway for humanity to enter into.

It helped people with their intuition about the world,
it made knowledge, wisdom, kindness and compassion beautiful.

When a person says, “I don’t lie, as I couldn't keep track of all my lies”,
is not a funny joke.

It is a commentary,
on people that aren’t aware of authenticity.

---

To be a gentleman or not to be a gentleman,
is not a caste system – liars will present it as that.

They’ll go as far as stating that,
growing up as an individual is a cult,

Where it is the opposite, the ennobled woman or man,
are unique and stand alone individuals.

Once beautifully described as
sovereign, intransigent minds.

It is a choice towards growing all the way up,
and striving to become a great being, a very inconvenient being to liars.

 A lot of good behind Humanity today,
exists because of Gentle-deeds, and letting go of gentleness.

Makes the goodness go away, pulls us back in time,
therefore we must stand up for decency and wisdom.

We must learn to continue growing,
and grow all the way up.

Until we each become a sovereign,
intransigent great being.

Finally, the word gentle is from middle english
and it means, ennobled.

A gentle being,
is one who is ennobled by his or her deeds.

If you are still in High School,
trying to figure out where the liars are…

Here is a famous Honor Code for you,
you can rely on to build firm albeit lonely plateaus.

“You will not lie, cheat, steal,
nor tolerate those who do.”

And your first application is as close as your next test,
it means no cramming, no memorization, comprehension only.

Which in turn will expose your school,
as cheating you out of real knowledge, by coercing you into memorization.

Before long you will discover that every challenge that lies before you,
is a deed that can ennoble you as you grow, and an invitation to greatness.
