Before we sent a man to the moon,
we actually landed and brought back an angry raccoon.

Geese prefer to walk when crossing the street,
because they hope someone will toss them a sweet treat.

Skunks don't know they spray something bad, in their culture,
perfuming a friend is a sign of love and nurture.

The cute little Sparrow is by far most intellectual of birds,
that is why professionals bird watchers often call them nerds.

Unbelievably with the bushiest of tails is found on the Opossum,
but they shave them, because they think it makes the look awesome.

The first creature to make god money from religion,
was actually an dank, old, cranky pigeon.

Not all coyotes are scary or ugly,
some are actually very loving and snugly.

And ducks are always so hasty,
because they know humans have long figured out, they are tasty.

Hunters often have an easy time with Deer,
because Deer love the smell of mud-ass and beer.

Seagulls like the beach, because they get tickles when they land,
on something other than sand.

Back in 1950 Chipmunks helped to manufacture the first microchips,
as they have really tiny and nimble fingertips.

Hawks are energetic but easily bored,
so they try to look scary, as not come across as Hawkward.

Squirrels used to fight along-side of European Knights,
as they could sneak into enemy's armor, and bite them, right in their, tights.

When we feel the first drops of rain that is often just the Owls
as the weather right before rain really helps them to clear out their bowels.

Most Humans are animals too,
and many write poems that aren't _always_ true.
