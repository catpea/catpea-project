We see the incredible power of endurance,
when a jolly joggers runs by.

Above all, they are not out of breath,
and sometimes, are having a freaking conversation.

Not only are they not desperately sucking wind,
but they are not stopping every few moments.

And as if to add insult to injury,
they don’t; even need to walk part of the way.

---

A non-stop endurance jog,
from start to finish...

Is an incredible, display of one of our greatest superpowers:
the superpower of endurance.

Earned by gradually increasing workout complexity,
and defiantly decreasing rest periods.

---

Even if you are hell bent
on becoming a beef cupcake bodybuilder…

Then using increased endurance as the foundation,
as a kind of a rail road…

Is sure to deliver you to beef status,
that much sooner.

---

Whatever other fitness paths there are,
jogging is the simplest, and __surely__ the healthiest.

---

Finally, jogging does build muscle,
and you can gradually add ankle and wrist weights,

Slowly build up your way, towards, carrying dumbbells during your workout.
and gently add weight vest,

And just like your legs grew initially,
to account for a full non-stop jog.

The rest of your body will begin adapting,
to the newly added weights.

This will include your abdominal muscles,
which are used during your jog, weighted down or not.

And your upper body, including your shoulders,
hanging on to dumbbells during a jog.

Has impact on all muscles,
from wrists to ankles.

---

Be good to yourself, your mind and your body,
don’t go too fast, don’t rest too long…

And your body will cheerfully adapt,
with little complaint, before you know it.
