There is much more to you and the universe,
than you were shown, than you have dreamt about.

You have received a largely fake education,
certainly greatly ineffective.

And were indoctrinated into a religious cult,
or at the very least the tolerance of warping of the minds of the young.

You learned to tolerate lies, political promises,
wars, and crimes.

We are individuals,
we find our wisdom in our uniqueness first.

Slowly any and all groups,
will come to be exploited.

And by the worst of the very people,
whom their unity was meant to help.

Rendering the most innocent, a victim again,
but now, by an enemy from within.

Ultimately groups are divisions,
and Humans are just one family.

---

This just means we are not heard animals,
we are independent thinkers, warriors.

We are meant to rise as individuals,
where we excel and become unique.

Only after we become wise enough to stand against the liars and mind hackers,
and especially the blind and ravenous opportunists.

Can we, pause, and look around;
for friends to make, and things to build.

Until then we will be used, mislead,
and made old, as we go blind from induced poverty and stress.

Humans are beautiful, and powerful,
but they need rising and individuality.

It is how we grow up,
and the only way to make large lasting contributions to the world.

Here is one simple little sentence, a charm:
"Grow, grow all the way up, until you become a great being."

For all the terrible mistakes in the world,
this will pull young minds out of the loop of repetition.

It is a compressed rejection of in-authenticity,
of tolerance of mediocrity.

A beneficial program for the mind,
to set its self free from fantasy, servitude, blind hope, and fake education.

Its result is a simple step towards the library,
to first set aside all the fake books.

And find out who the real great beings are,
befriend them on long relaxing hiking adventures.

And listen to them, and inherit their culture and wisdom,
and continue on the path they started.

Rising, rising,
on the shoulders of giants.
