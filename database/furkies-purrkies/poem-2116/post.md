If we get out of shape, we can’t start repairs by trying to jog,
that is too hard, too painful, too overwhelming, and may not be healthy at all.

We have to start, by walking, and then walk a little bit longer,
and then go hiking, and add bicycling, and weekend warrior adventure.

Please, you must not think of this as an active lifestyle,
this is the on-ramp to a healthy body, and painless bodybuilding.

---

You must always increase the level of activity,
bicycle faster, power walk faster, with heavier dumbbells.

You have to stay right at the edge of what your body can do,
and your body will continue adapting, and let you do more.

---

If you listen to dad type advice, where they have to say something smart,
or start packing, they will say lift heavy, and be consistent – those rascals.

That is wrong, because that puts you somewhere in the middle,
and you can’t lift for long enough, for you body to register that you are thying.

Just like a fat person trying to jog on his first day,
it will be painful, crushing, dangerous, and they will run out of breath too soon.

If they gave themselves a chance, by power walking first, or hiking long distances,
their body would allow them a slow non-stop jog.

It would be pretty much ache free, no big pains,
and they would not run out of breath.

Running for an hour without running out of breath,
will let your body rapidly adapt, so that you can run faster.

The same is true for bodybuilding, don’t choke yourself,
start with power-walking or hiking.

Then move on to 1980 aerobics, that will now work on all your your muscles,
when dancing dumbbells affect all your muscles.

It is the craziest thing in the world,
the most authentic exercise, we should all practice.

And when you add heavier dumbbells to aerobics,
you enter the bodybuilding zone.

At 10 pounds per hand, for an hour, to slow songs,
you become muscular.

You can make your way all the way up to 20,
then you just become a muscle, and scare all the boys away.

---

But you have to go gradually, starting with power walking first,
and you retain that one hour of motion as you gradually move onto harder exercise.

If you just start in the middle, like boys do,
then you can only lift for 15 seconds, like a fat person jogging.

You can lift heavy things, but that’s not exercise,
that is using the body you have exercised.

---

Exercise is not the breakneck, heaviest you can,
painful lifting for a tiny bit.

Exercise, is an weighted, endurance thing,
that one hour of lifting the heaviest you can, non stop.

Is what does,
the building.

It is not how heavy you lift,
it is how long you lift your heavy for.

---

You have to go back down in weight,
so that you can lift for an hour.

And then you will break through your too-heavy-not-long-enough plateau,
and your body will resume quickly adapting again, like it did the first time.
