I think we will be struck by the urge to write, thrice,
in out bright teenage days, magnificent middle age, and the golden, epic age.

Somehow, Humanity forget that we don’t get old,
that old age is a privilege, denied to all to many.

Remembering that, living a strong life forward,
will take us to weave an epic out of our wisdom.

This here, is a poem about the first urge,
the discovery that stories are not to be merely told…

That stories, already live within us,
and they just need a gentle lattice.

---

Let us call it a reversal of roles,
where the story tells it self, and you just become an epic writer.

Before destroyed by stupid greedy charlatans,
cards similar to tarot emerged all around the world.

They were a powerful machine,
for both the Noble Philosopher, and the Royal Storyteller.

When a time came to turn a new page,
the thinker would shuffle and draw.

Letting the story tell all by it self,
as if powered by the machinery of the universe it self.

I will now ask you to write down numbers 16,
in a random sequence, and I will give you 16 cards…

That you should follow in your own random sequence;
if your first number is 16, then you start at the lower right… and write…

Never write more than two pages,
try to end at the last line of the first page.

I will now tell you, a few facts about cats, I am sorry,
I worry that this will influence your story….

Alas, I want to make sure you sit down to write,
we live by a third generation start, and life sprung on Earth, instantly.

And although no one counted the failed attempts,
we can neither think that we are at the center of universe…

Nor that DNA based life begun shortly after the ignition of our own sun,
no species, will ever allow themselves to perish.

There will be a ship, wisely forged within an already moving asteroid,
now, now, Please, tell the real story of [Omuamua][1]

Afterword, these story cards have been generated at random,
by a free and open source program called Stable Diffusion.

Unfortunately, it requires an expensive computer,
find a way, find a way to learn how to use it, it is an important program for your future.

Because, it can dream up all the illustrations,
for your beautiful chronicles.

Ps.

Write down numbers between 1 and 16:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16

and [use random.org list randomizer](https://www.random.org/lists/) to shuffle them.
