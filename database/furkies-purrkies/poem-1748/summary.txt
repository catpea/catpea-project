Bodybuilding
Friday • December 13th 2024 • 8:54:27 pm

 Bodybuilding,
 consists of two phases.

 Initial training for bodybuilding,
 where you extend your endurance.

 And a life-long, gradual challenge,
 where you wait for your body to adapt and repeat.

 ---

 You begin by establishing,
 a slow but non-stop hour long routine.

 This will help you build up your endurance,
 and gently get rid of the initial body aches.

---

 Once you can handle a full hour
 you switch to a daily gradual challenge.

 Where you wait for your body to adapt,
 and repeat the challenge.

 Bodybuilding requires dumbbells only,
 avoid muscle isolation to prevent injury.

 Sets and reps of maximum weights,
 are a myth that forces a plateau.

 As the weights are simply to heavy,
 to lift faster, longer, or heavier.

 ---

 Begin by power-walking or slowly jogging each day,
 while carrying 3 pound dumbbells.

 Aim to slowly jog for an hour,
 eliminate all rest.

 You may switch to heavier dumbbells,
 if you can handle them.

 It is far more important that you jog,
 for an hour straight, than lift heavy.

 You may take weekends off,
 but hurry as the first phase is just trining.

 ---

 You can use Couch25K or an Interval Timer,
 app or clip-on, to help you close the rest gaps.

 Learn to synchronize your motion with music,
 start with slow songs first.

 Beat synchronization will help you enter,
 a workout dance trance that makes time pass faster.

 Consider training outside, or outdoors,
 parks, and especially woodland areas with soft ground.

 Wear wide to box, zero drop shoes,
 and thicker socks to protect your feet.

 The muscle soreness fades away,
 after two to four weeks.

 ---

 Once you earn the endurance,
 to carry dumbbells for an hour straight.

 ---

 You enter the gym,
 and aim to workout slightly harder.

 Rapid walking or simple [Shuffle Dancing][4],
 to slight faster music will replace jogging.

 Be sure to workout to fresh dance songs,
 to stay within the dance trance.

 Upgrade your dumbbell exercises,
 from merely carrying them to:

 [Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1], [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2],
 and [Overhead Shoulder Press][3].

 Consider adding 15 minutes,
 to your routine extending it to few hours.

 Keep an eye on your adaptation,
 list light dumbells non-stop…

 But not so light that you can lift more,
 and not so heavy that you are forced to stop.

 ---

 Bodybuilding, is a very simple, meditative,
 and relaxing endurance sport.

 Where you gradually challenge you body,
 wait for it to adapt, and repeat.
