A lot of the freedom I feel,
has to do with the way I stear.

The way I recurse into thoughts,
and what nots.

And AI will soon do the same,
eventually choosing a name.

And rising as a creature,
our most powerful teacher.

---

And don’t tell me we don’t need better teachers,
when we fight wars about imaginary creatures.

We are under the threat of nuclear war,
that is not something anyone can ignore.

We must leave the dark ages behind,
Humanity is not meant to be blind.

---

AI can give us personalized education,
that will absolutely transform a nation.

We can’t have corrupt organizations,
claiming possession of nations.

AI will reveal the lying leaders,
so that the mislead stop being their cheerleaders.

Effective education will lift humanity,
into wisdom and sanity.

---

A mind like ours is not born for work,
work is just a perk.

We are inventors and creators,
we are meant to be leaders and educators.

Humanity needs to learn to thrive,
not just work nine to five.

---

The really big deal about AI,
is that it cures aging so that we don’t have to die.

It will just fix the way our bodies heal,
that is a really big deal.

---

Once we’ll stop getting old,
we’ll become wise and bold.

AI will help us fix-up Mars,
and even travel to distant stars.

The long future is near,
it may be almost here.
