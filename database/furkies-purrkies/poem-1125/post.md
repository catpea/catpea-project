Endurance is such a simple thing,
that we often forget we have it.

---

The best example is jogging,
where gradual adaptation is key.

You can only run a little bit at first,
and it will be painful.

Though you should know,
we kind have two kinds of pain.

One is when we are really hurt,
and the other is a reminder.

It is about conserving resources,
and not pushing too hard.

If you do push through pain of jogging,
then you are rewarded.

By being able to jog,
a little bit more.

If you keep going,
you can approach Olympic speeds.

---

I think endurance is huge for health,
and cannot be replicated by any means.

It has to be earned,
by gradually increasing the workload.

The point is not to compete, or win,
but to continue advancing to no end.

---

Even if you are aware of endurance,
surely, you are not mindful of trance.

This is the music component,
basically, hit every beat.

If you are jogging at night,
music could seem crazy compared to nature.

But, once you get tired of the crickets,
narrated books will take you to the next level.

---

But endurance does not stop with jogging,
it is where it starts.

Every muscle in your body,
can increase in endurance.

Here, it is not a question of knowing,
but rather falsehoods.

3 sets of 10 repetitions,
is probably just a myth.

Perhaps small gym owners came up with it,
to free up space or machines.

If sets and reps are in fact true,
muscles with endurance are still more useful.

Using endurance to work on biceps, is only weird,
until you start dancing with dumbbells.

---

Working your entire body,
as in during dancing.

Will start enhancing your entire musculature,
and it will grow like a tree.

Your legs, get the most at first,
until they adapt.

Your shoulders may jump into second,
because you are holding dumbbells.

Like legs,
shoulders are support component.

Then your midsection,
which includes abdominals.

And then your arms,
dancing is an amazing workout.

It is even more amazing,
because it challenges you...

To stop acting like everyone else at the gym,
in my experience that hurts more than the workout.

You will never regret,
working out your full body first.

As a bonus, whatever your exercise,
it will enable you to jog long distances.

---

Finally, aside from music and,
gradually increasing complexity.

There is the matter of the window,
which allows you to progress into the next window.

Beyond the top of the window,
you get stopped due to your weights being too heavy.

You get stopped before you get to the point,
that alerts your body to increase endurance.

And the bottom of the window,
is not working out enough.

Which again, will fail to send the signal,
to adapt, because there is just nothing to adapt to.

Here the fake pain, which is trying to force you,
to be careful with your resources.

Useful for animals, but not so much for potatoes,
couch potatoes, that is.

Can easily, trick you, or make the workout feel wrong,
and this is where music or narrated books come in.

A little bit of fun, or distraction,
goes a long way.

You'll be glad to know,
that the pain goes away after a while.

You may feel an ache or two the next time,
you push a bit harder, but that too goes away.

Whether you are dancing or jogging,
make sure you have your dumbbells with you.

Afterword,

Those of you who maybe starting to jog,
may wish to consider larger and wide or "EE" shoes,

And heavy thick woolen socks,
as this could help you avoid blisters.

Blisters only happen the first time you jog,
they don't continue developing as you keep going.

If your back starts hurting,
it is your bed, flat beds are a crazy cheap idea.

You need a bet that lifts your feet,
and your back, it is nothing like the regular mattress.

You may also consider neoprene weight loss belts,
they don't actually work for weight loss...

Other than causing you,
to lose precious water.

But they do work,
to keep your muscles all warmed up and more flexible.
