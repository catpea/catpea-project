The Super Culture; Or The Road To Wisdom, Fairness, And World Peace
Friday • November 4th 2022 • 9:36:38 pm

The line is blurry, a spectrum, religion is a designed culture,
whereas Criminal Minds arise from emergent culture.

Emergent means, disorganized,
a thing builds it self out of complexity.

Nobody really sat down to create world’s gangs,
they just emerged out of poverty, and continue reemerging.

A designed culture, is an organized one,
means funny hats and money collection trays.

There isn’t one person that benefits, up top,
there is usually a hundred or thousands.

The little guy on top, is just a lighting rod,
when it gets enough bad press it gets replaced.

---

A hard-won culture, is something somewhat off-the chart,
it is the Philosopher, the Athlete, the Adventurer.

It emerges out of the best in us,
out of the things that are all to human.

There is a benefit, but it is such a challenge,
that you don’t care about benefits.

The hard one cultures only care about,
self betterment, without an aim in sight.

---

I write this at a terrible time,
where we have tragically lost teenagers.

To a designed culture,
but not without response.

Aside from protests, in their infinite ways and bravery,
they took to knocking the funny hats off of people’s heads.

---

This is a poem about Unity,
World Unity.

I wanted to let you know,
that to enter a culture, is to enter a tunnel.

There is away out,
but it first requires an inner desire to exit the culture.

And second,
moving, moving far and away from the other practitioners.

And starting a new life,
without ever looking back.

---

I was once asked into a Jury Duty programme,
the defendant stole a car.

When I said that I am unqualified for Jury Duty,
because I am self taught.

He saw hope in me,
and kept skipping other Jurors to try to pick me.

Without thinking,
I instantly recognized that he broke out of the culture he was raised in.

The threat of real prison,
made him break out of the one that his mind was in.

He wasn’t the same person anymore,
he was new, meant to be free.

---

The courtroom invalidated it self,
the Judge became a clown, in a scary circus.

The judge stoppped him from skipping over the other jurors,
I was not picked, and asked to leave, I left traumatized for life.

They were going to betray that man,
because they didn’t know culture made him do it.
