How To Reliably Fluff Up Your Tail For Halloween
Wednesday • October 23rd 2024 • 11:00:55 pm

To show the world that you live on a different scale,
just put on a tail.

Wear it to celebrate life and universe,
or just as a purse.

A tail changes everything,
especially at work where it can only add to your zing.

Buuuut, you need to care for your tail,
lest it grows limp and frail.

---

Don’t just wear it each Halloween,
parade with it in between.

Wear it every few weeks,
or weekly, if you still practice you techniques.

This will ensure that the fluff stays fluffy,
and your tail looks nice and puffy.

---

But the stuffing wears,
so eventually the tail will shows its years.

---

And I am sorry to say,
but be as it may.

If you want to give it more fluff,
you will need to tear open a pillow and stuff.

Try to make a little hole,
and take a little bit of stuffing, not all.

And unless you live alone,
you don’t have to fluff up with your own.

Leave the pillow looking well,
and no one will be able to tell.

---

Deep: Why is my pillow so flat,
and why is your tail sticking up like that.

I wear my tail weekly now,
as it helps me get promotions somehow.

So my fluff settled and the tail grew limp,
and since your pillow was always such a blimp.

It was all the stuffing I could find,
I didn’t think you’d notice or mind.

Deep: You know to be honest with you,
I now wear two.
