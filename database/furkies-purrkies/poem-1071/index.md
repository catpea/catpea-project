The beautiful lessons we learn are little flowers,
and those decorate our lifelines.

Someday, we will live forever,
we’ll take to the stars and quickly colonize the Milky Way.

Those cats will be allowed to get busy from time to time,
but we are too beautiful for busy – we are artists.

---

Just the moment you hear yourself thinking,
“Oh, my gosh I am so busy, there is always so much to do.”

You have to change your life for better,
because, busy is the privilege of immortals.

Don’t take my word for it,
close your eyes, travel far into the future…

And ask your elder self,
what their regrets are.

---

That’s right,
busy is bad.

---

Above all, take care of your body,
unless you are a raccoon, don’t eat garbage.

The health of your body decides,
how long before you have to return to the peaceful silence that you came from.

For busy people especially, sometimes,
that is a difference of 30 years, maybe more.

---

Take care of your mind,
the empties that we tend to fill with overwork…

Is often rooted in misunderstanding of life,
and our place in universe.

You will need to listen to thousands of narrated books,
I recommend 10,000 or more.

The intellectuals, philosophers, the well read,
want nothing more than for you to learn.

They are your extended family,
it won’t take very many books…

Before you realize how true that is,
and how lovely all of them are.

---

And of course, you will need to replace,
making yourself busy.

With making time for yourself,
and I urge you to begin immediate.

It matters not if you are young or in your golden age,
order a backpack, now.

And as you take to walking, and jogging,
fill it with all the little bits you will need.

Tent, sleeping bag, solar charger,
cut prof gloves, a mean knife with extremely tick body.

Take vacations more often,
and at first, make sure to spend at least one night per vacation, in your tent.

---

We are beautiful adventures,
try as hard as you can to spent three months a year traveling.

Remember, your elder self is watching you,
they demand that you practice Wisdom and live in Happiness.

Long months filled with tiny adventures,
will help you listen deeply to your books.

It is difficult to adjust to all this at first,
your job will slowly become optimized for taking everything.

Without health you cannot have adventure,
and without adventure you will never be able to fully hear the wisdom in your books.

---

You are not supposed to torture yourself with an alarm clock every morning,
you are not supposed to wait for wednesday to blindly get to anoter weekend.

You are supposed to treat each day of your life,
as a precious treasure, and it should fill you with joy, love of life is not optional.

But above all, you are meant to grow all the way up,
until, with knowledge and wisdom, you become a great being and do your elder self justice.
