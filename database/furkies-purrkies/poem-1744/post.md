If you are obese, that means, one you already have good muscle,
they come from carrying the extra weight.

But it also means, you have the nutrition necessary,
to power your endurance bodybuilding.

If you want it fast, extend your endurance to three hours,
and attack your rest gaps, eliminating them as much as possible.

You have all the nutrition endurance athlete needs,
now you just build up your endurance.

And in that extended workout, your body will use its energy reserves,
now exposing much bigger muscles.

Earned by non-stop workouts with multiple dumbbell exercises,
stacked to let muscle groups rest.

You become a muscular warrior,
are you disadvantaged by easily becoming a powerful athlete?

The above shows,
that there is no such thing as ugly.

In fact people who feel that way,
have an extra motivation to transform their bodies.

Yet again, this is not a disadvantage,
it is an extra force of motivation.

True ugliness exists, but,
it is a result of deliberately vile acts.

You don’t even know,
how to use the word ugly right.

Give yourself abdominal muscles,
from shuffle dancing at the gym…

Or becoming a fierce surfer,
or an AT, PCT, CDT trail guide that transform lives.

And Old,
is a choice.

It is the choice to not be fit,
to say on the couch, and let your muscles atrophy.

There is nothing more fierce, among men or animal,
than a muscular golden lady.

Our bodies are animals,
and just like a horse or any large animal, they need to run outside.

Daily, rain, snow, shine, thunder,
or fat old ladies jealously gossiping away about what a hussy you are.

Bodybuilding is great,
but fitness is better.

We are meant to be fit,
not just taking a walk in the morning.

But a daily walk to the store,
so that groceries aren’t too heavy on any one day.

We need to keep our bodies renewing themselves,
there is no such thing as retirement and sitting around.

This is when camping and hiking,
visiting lakes and beaches becomes a lifestyle.

Always flexing,
always moving.

The pain is there, if any,
because of not using muscles enough.

It is just part of life,
it is part of adventure.

Stay fit,
and you’ll never get old.

Finally,
[disadvantage is what makes a trail blazer][1].

People who think they have it all,
won’t always rise to the challenge of life.

But [rising is what humans do, and it is rarely pretty][2],
but we are each meant to grow all they way up until we become a great being.

It is no wonder that the extra force,
of believing that you are at some disadvantage, actually give you an edge.

It makes you rise harder, faster,
and more beautifully.

Get to it, get your narrated books, get your jogging shoes,
or get your camping gear ready.

Life is not going to be ordinary for you,
everything that will come your way will be of your own making.

You should feel lucky,
because ordinary people, if they even exist, will never discover a reason to rise.
