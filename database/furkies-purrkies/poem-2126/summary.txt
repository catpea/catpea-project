## I. The Weight of Unsolved Things

Lena Meijer had not slept properly in three months. The kind of not-sleeping that accumulates like sediment in a riverbed, each night adding another layer until you can barely remember what clarity felt like. At twenty-six, she was the youngest doctoral candidate in MIT's cryptography program, and she was drowning.

Her dissertation on elliptic curve vulnerabilities had stalled. The math was beautiful—she could see that—but she couldn't find her way through it. Every time she sat down to work, the symbols blurred, her thoughts scattered, and a low hum of panic set in that made her chest tight and her hands shake.

"You're burned out," her advisor had said. "Take a break. Go somewhere without WiFi."

So she went to the Appalachian Trail.

Day four. Somewhere in Virginia, climbing toward McAfee Knob. Her legs ached in a good way now—a physical ache that drowned out the mental noise. She had stopped checking her phone. Stopped thinking about prime factorization and discrete logarithms. Started noticing things: the way morning light filtered through rhododendron leaves, the particular sound of her boots on packed earth, the rhythm of her own breathing.

At a shelter that night, she met a retired archaeologist named Dr. Irene Vasquez, seventy-two years old and section-hiking her way to Maine one summer at a time.

"What do you do?" Irene asked over instant oatmeal.

"Cryptography," Lena said. "Or I'm supposed to. I study how to break codes. And how to make codes that can't be broken."

Irene's eyes lit up. "Have you ever heard of the Phaistos Disc?"

## II. The Disc

Irene pulled out her phone—"I lied, I do carry it for photos"—and showed Lena an image of a clay disc covered in stamped symbols, spiraling inward from edge to center.

"Found in Crete in 1908," Irene explained. "About four thousand years old. Forty-five different signs, stamped with individual punches—like a Bronze Age printing press. Two hundred and forty-one symbols total. And in over a century, no one has cracked it."

Lena felt something stir in her chest—the old feeling...
