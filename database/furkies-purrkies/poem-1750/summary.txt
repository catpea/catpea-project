Yes You Can; Or, Explosive Workouts For Golden Ladies
Sunday • December 15th 2024 • 10:47:50 pm

A great part of becoming weaker,
comes from not getting enough exercise.

If you only move a round a little bit,
your muscles will atrophy.

You may remember what that looks like,
if you ever had a cast to let a bone heal.

Astronauts coming down from the space station,
are another example of losing muscles.

We are meant to be very active,
animal active, [always on the move][1], hopping around.

---

The finest example of living life right,
came around in 1980’s with aerobic videos.

People who stayed with aerobics,
haven’t aged a day, ladies.

They are more fit than ever,
stronger, and of course wiser.

That is not aging,
that is the opposite of aging.

---

They grew,
and so can you.

---

And the answer to how,
is one word: GRADUALLY.

You start with a walk, yes,
but, as your body gets used to it.

You stay out there a little longer,
and then learn to walk a little faster.

And then you will need a fanny pack,
and light leg weights, and weight bracelets for your wrists.

And you will need to prepare,
for jealousy, as the other ladies lay their eggs.

There will be aches, and bruises,
I scratched arm and hurt my back when I begun.

I begun bicycling,
as walking is hard.

And soapy water at a distant gas station floor,
and my bike pedal, conspired to may me fly, ouch.

I showed my would to the pharmacists,
and he thought it was just a scrape - I flew.

And then when I started slowly jogging,
at just about the speed of walking.

I missed a curb at night,
and it turned out I had six more inches to the ground.

And I could feel it in my back,
it hurt for a long while.

---

Pain is a signal of life,
avoiding pain is not health.

You are a tough bird,
an you should act like it.

Be wise, think ahead,
have comfy shoes and thick socks.

And always gradually,
[increase the intensity][2].

Of the challenge,
that you pose to your body.

Not all at once,
you have to wait until your body adapts.

And then wait some more,
until you feel like you can do better.

And gradually increase something,
not so light that you can add more.

But not so heavy,
that you will have to stop.

---

You have to keep your body function,
keep increasing that challenge.

Keep an eye on your fitness,
asking when was the last time I was like this.

And slowly you will see,
that fitness makes you younger.

It is not the original youth,
it is your second youth.

A much more powerful,
and wiser kind of youth.
