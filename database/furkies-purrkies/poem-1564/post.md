Effective bodybuilding in general, is a form or living art,
speaking in terms of glucose, anaerobic and aerobic exercise is a kind of science.

In real life, you don’t want glucose pills or jogging gels, and brown rice and noodles may not work,
you want what produces results in context of a particular workout routine.

And trail mix works in context of endurance bodybuilding,
to provide a reliable daily return of muscle strength.

Endurance bodybuilding, is about lifting weights non-stop,
for multiple hours.

Gradually transitioning from jogging type exercise,
to a slow weight lifting type routine, while keeping the extended duration.

You lift what you can for extended durations,
building up endurance the way joggers do.

But unlike joggers,
you keep increasing the weights.

Eventually the weights grow to heavy to move fast due to inertial forces,
and even though you slow to a crawl, you keep the extended workout duration.

It is a pretty loud way to tell you body that it needs to adapt,
and you have to take care to do so gradually and wisely.

This is a very safe kind of bodybuilding, as lifting light,
does not really cause any injuries, though yo will need good running shoes.

Your muscles will get tired for lifting dumbbells for several hours,
you may yawn, feel flimsy, and your muscles will stop feeling strong.

You will still grow muscles and burn fat,
due to the constant gradual increase in duration and load.

But you will fell that something is missing from your muscles,
to be precise, you will feel a certain kind of rubber quality will be missing.

When you are rested and get your diet just right,
or goodness forbid take a few days off, please don’t.

Resuming lifting anew will surprise you,
with the feeling of rubber bands in your muscles.

For a second it will feel like you are not lifting,
but the dumbell is just automatically returning because of the rubber feeling.

---

That is not the result of rest, or protein having been given time,
to heal your body.

That is actually, due to your muscles having been replenished with energy,
because you weren’t spending it during rest.

And that feeling and power can be re-created without rest,
by simply stuffing yourself with trail mix.

---

It is up to you to figure out how much trail mix is too much,
but as you are testing this out, for the first few days, have as much as hikers eat.

As to why this and not the popular jogging gels is more effective,
it is probably because traimix is hard to digest.

Unlike a gel that may work for an hour,
your traimix works to power you day and night.

It is likely that that steady availability of what muscles need,
restores or reloads muscle energy at speeds fast enough for long daily workouts.

Lastly I wanted to ask you to experiment,
don’t just read a book about bodybuilding and follow its advice.

Bodybuilding success is so rare,
because those books present models as life.

In real life, you don’t just need glucose for energy -
a hiker hoping to cross the Appalachian Trail with a bag of glucose will fail.

But a hiker with a proper supply of trail mix, protein bars,
sausages, and various healthy snacks, will do just fine diet wise.

Furthermore, look a the results at your local gym,
very few people succeed.

That is the damage caused by bad advice born of misuse of scientific models,
by health professionals who are all to eager to give incomplete advice.
