When winter calls for mittens,
and you like little kittens….

You are in luck,
because no squirrel likes to be a cold duck.

Just scatter some nuts,
and without any buts…

Squirrels will follow you home,
and begin to cheerfully prance and roam.

---

Once kept for luck by queens, and kings,
they are amazing cute little things.

---

When you save them from cold ice,
they become courageous and very nice.

Of all the things they like the most,
thy love grooming their winter host.

---

Say goodbye to need for a comb,
because in return for a warm home…

They will use their furry litter hands,
to take care of all your hair strands.

They can do dishes, laundry, and carpets.
Truly, they are fantastic pets, no regrets.

---

They get very sad when it is too cold to play,
especially on the first and second snow day.

So go put on your hat and mittens,
and bring back some happy mini kittens.

They will always think of you as smart and clever,
and bring you good luck forever.
