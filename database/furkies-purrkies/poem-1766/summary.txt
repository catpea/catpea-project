Neat New Year Resolutions
Tuesday • December 31st 2024 • 10:26:10 pm

On January 1st, as you gag everyone with,
“Nice to see you again, I haven't seen you since last year.”

Consider the following New Year resolutions,
to make 2025 the year you never forget.

---

First of all, [become a bodybuilder][bb],
it is extremely easy when you do it right.

It begins with very slow jogging for an hour with light dumbbells,
but no so light that you can carry more, and always keep an eye on that.

If jogging is too much, begin by walking,
and then get a bicycle, you’ll be shuffling your feet before you know it.

And then after you can comfortably jog with 5 or even 10 pounds per hand,
go to the gym and start performing all the sanding dumbbell exercises.

Keep an eye on those dumbbell weights,
and make sure they are not so heavy that they stop you, stay in the zone.

---

Second, become an adventurer, and [set off to cross the triple crown][tc],
the Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide trails.

Bring all your narrated books, this way you can learn wisdom from philosophers,
and science from science popularizer and return smart as heck.

The journey may take as little as two years,
but the longer you are out there, the more intellectually powerful you become.

---

[Lean programming, JavaScript especially][js], it run in the browser,
on the sever, in browser extensions, makes linux commands.

JavaScript can be compiled to small executable,
especially now that you don't need extra modules, as you can ask AI for what you need.

And with electron, or nw.js it can make powerful desktop applications,
where you already have UI frameworks like bootstrap, and tested libraries.

Don’t listen to the smaller executable is better people,
they don’t follow that rule, they are just jealous of what the browser can do.

---

[Learn how to use the LMMS, digital audio workstation][mm],
it is very easy, there are many tutorials.

And you compose music by just adding sounds you fgenerate with AI,
on a grid, when you hit play, a vertical bar crosses the grid.

And whatever is in a cell plays,
using a piano roll is just as easy.

---

Learn [precision 3D modeling][3d] from video tutorials, and get yourself a 3D printer,
so that you can print your creations.

3D modeling is extremely easy, all your shapes consists of dots and lines,
and you just move them around, or divide or join them.

Furthermore, when modeling, you can use the imprecise mouse,
because every movement you make in Blender triggers a do you want to correct box.

And there you can enter the precise values,
making everything align perfectly – 3D modeling is very easy and friendly.

---

And finally, a real treat to get comfortable with using Artificial Intelligence,
[2025 will be a huge year for AI][ai], so it is time to learn.

To fully cover nearly every function AI is good at,
create a virtual leader, similar to how e-girls exist.

Combine at least three famous leaders or thinkers, for example,
Abraham Lincoln, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Socrates.

And tell the AI to translate what this mix is saying,
into the words of a famous writer or poet, maybe Kurt Vonnegut.

And ask for chapters to just 100 page books,
ask for poems and speeches.

Publish the books, as that is a unique and creative use of technology,
and setup something that looks like a podium, and perform the speeches.

This is a very good exercise, that could get you into real politics,
this is why your e-leader persona should be wise, rather than a dictator.

Clone your voice, and have AI create inspirational Audio Books,
it is not fake, when you go over everything, it is just creative exploration.

As a result, if you don’t want tot do politics yourself,
you could create an agency that helps other political candidates.

Sometimes it is great help, just to be able to point out,
that their competition is using AI, and give an informed guess as to how.

And early on as you learn programming setup websites for books,
for the speeches, and even community forums.

Here you can have AI impersonating users, just to get ahead,
just to see how that works.

But also talk to the bots, correct them, steer them,
make no mistake, 2025 is the year of the future.

And you should make it,
your year as well.
