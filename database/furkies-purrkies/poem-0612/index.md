I am always cheerfully up to something artistic or smart,\
only for a train to toot the horn and ruin my little art.

I lived most of my life next to train tracks,\
and the loud noise the horn makes, sucks.

---

More than train tracks, the train crossings are awful too,\
in America they ring a constant bell to annoy you.

What a wretched thing a train operator is,\
as when the horn goes off, the fault is all his.

---

I always take the philosophical view,\
always considering the crew.

Being started countless times by their stupid horn,\
I view them with nothing but scorn.

---

Each time I hear that frightful noise,\
I see that pushing buttons is something that-ugly-man enjoys.

He pushes the horn button multiple times in his incompetence,\
and I call it "horn incontinence".

I do feel bad that he works nights far away from home,\
tooting horn to his irritable bowel syndrome.

But I know his family needs a break,\
for their own sake.

---

Now, I will admit, it was my destiny to drive trains,\
crisscrossing all the great plains.

While everyone wanted to become an attorney,\
I just wanted to go on a fancy train journey.

There is great wisdom in exploration,\
out lives should not be lived in resignation.

Rather than trains I ended up lifting weights,\
all the way out in Unites States.

And I don't want to ride trains anymore,\
I prefer a nice and quiet bookstore.

---

Even though I don't want to RIDE the train,\
I still wish to complain.

Especially about that damn horn,\
to which I seem to have been born.

---

Let us never forget that the train man could use the horn just one time,\
instead he plays the song of his people - which should be a crime.

So next time you are stuck waiting for a train and hear the horn afar,\
[honk back at him from own your car](files/train.mp3).
