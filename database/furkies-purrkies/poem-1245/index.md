World leaders studying UFOs,
calls for real, profound, and meaningful education.

Overmedicated glitchy ghouls with an office full,
of puppeteers that tell them what to say, based on who paid the most.

Can only lead to more failures,
and an economic reboot by means of war.

---

This is not a path worthy of you,
you deserve better.

The only way out of this,
is independent self education.

The only kind of education,
that you can trust.

It is a path, traveled,
by all the great thinkers.

---

Begin at the libraries,
and start with narrated books.

---

If you were to ask,
how much of what you have been taught, is false.

The answer, would be that terrible one,
that you already know.

Begin in the beginning, therefore,
and start with life changing narrated books loved by intellectuals.

---

The reason you have trouble in school,
is because you are trying to learn.

And only the kids who pretend to learn pass,
to get good grades, you just need to memorize.

Memorization is not real education,
if you tried to memorize programming, you’d get nowhere.

Everything worth your while, is a little quest,
it is full of discovery color.

And driven purely, be the constellation,
of your won curiosities.

---

Everything is stacked against you,
for the purpose of turning you into a paycheck.

You are merely being played like a piano key,
by the medley of mad men who sold the world.

The very height of achievement,
is presented as either leadership or genies.

But today’s leadership are ghouls,
animated by mountains of pills.

And genius, is horseshit,
it is a play on human vulnerability, the need for meaning.

---

If you were to ask the great thinkers,
what helped them to the path of greatness.

They would tell you,
that they stopped memorizing…

And started,
learning for real.

All their achievements,
are a cascading result of just this change.

---

Do you see it?
You go to school to be taught.

And school, is neither effective,
nor do the teachers actually teach.

If you just use the projector in your art class,
to teach your peers how to pain selfies.

That would be infinitely more for all of you,
then all the years in school and the resulting debt.

The falsehoods do not end at graduation,
your career will ram you into stress and obesity.

And in order for you to be successful,
you will have to shorten your lifespan by decades.

---

You have to step back from that,
learn what call to you, and turn it into art.

If you don’t know where to start,
start by learning programming.

It is self guiding, and will show you,
what real education actually is.

---

Everything you do,
must come from within you.

You are as smart,
as all the great beings that have ever lived.

All you need, is to inherit the wisdom owed to you,
and to make your own way forward.

Never pretend to learn,
because "in a compromise between good and evil, only evil can profit" (Rand).

You are meant to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.
