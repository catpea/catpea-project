Demand real and effective education,
do not let mediocrity and liars undo hard won progress.

Nobody learns in a standardized sequence,
the larger the schools the more like factories they become.

To optimally process the most amount of meat,
standardized education became about memorization.

Memorization in context of education, is fantasy education,
that can only create a mere impression of knowledge.

Graduating from a standardized system of education,
is as meaningless as your recalling that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell - in your muddle age.

---

The mechanism behind this betrayal is similar to one behind a cult,
but the primary driving force is endless paychecks for effortlessly pretending to educate.

---

Your teachers belong to the group of men who have sold the world,
a very large group with a revolving door focused on money and cheap prestige.

The consequence of fake education can only lead to economic failure,
and a dark age possibly leading up to a war that nobody cared or knew to prevent.

It will certainly force the younger generation to repeat old mistakes,
terrible mistakes, that will undo hard earned progress.

---

Almost all of us now, have been born into a world held hostage,
by the broken idea of mutually assured destruction.

Ineffective education leads to ineffective politics, and ineffective leaders,
that can only drive the world into war and failure.

---

Resist teachers who present incomprehensible curricula,
with the sole purpose of forcing you into inventing memorization and cramming.

---

Real education is self directed,
it proceeds in the sequence, and at the pace that fits you best.

It is precisely like reading an interesting story,
where you simply must know what happens next.

The process of selling you out for a stable paycheck,
relies on your blind trust, and lack of experience, and intuition.

---

Begin asking if your classes are teaching you what you need,
or tricking you, so that the school keeps it accreditation and the teacher gets paid.

Ask if your teachers are preparing you for your future,
or simply feeding off of you, to put food on their own table.

---

Find a way by subtle analogy,
to whatever functional knowledge you hold dear.

To understand that learning something that you will never return to,
just keeps you preoccupied for long enough to push you out into graduation.

---

Donâ€™t let standardized education, principals and teachers,
and their make believe curricula them slow you down.

Demand to leap swiftly between your won curiosities,
in an endless brilliant spiral of education relevant to your pursuits.

Above all refuse memorization, reject cramming,
and demand that the curriculum is tailored to your own custom needs.

Your lesson plan must follow whatever your curiosity dictates next,
you can only learn and retain whilst traveling and revisiting path relevant to you.

---

Demand real, effective and relevant education now,
do not gamble with the content of your mind and character for a brand name diploma or make believe prestige.

Your teachers are not going to be around when you are tested by life,
but it is their duty to prepare you to rise to the greatest unforeseeable challenges.

There is nothing more important than real education that enhances your mind,
there is never time for memorization or trickery, or irrelevant facts.

Your duty in life, is to grow all the way up, until you become a great being,
and leave a positive legacy, of lasting contributions.
