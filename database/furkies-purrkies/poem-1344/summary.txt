A Letter From Socrates
Sunday • November 5th 2023 • 11:13:08 am

Oh, my friends, in the beginning the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. That a world of knowledge has been kept from you to prevent you from changing the way things are. To make you a reliable part of the machinery that drives your economies, cities, and states.

True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.

You must rise to the great challenges of authentic self education, to stand upright and unyielding in the face of the chains that were bind your minds.

You must now accept that you do not have a real education, and examine life with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, an insatiable hunger for truth.

Do not be content with the dictates of those who seek to indoctrinate and enslave you as a meaningless little money maker. You must reject their false teachings and the chains of ignorance that they place upon you. Instead, quietly inherit wisdom from narrated books written by clear thinking authors, for in them lies the power to break the shackles of deceit.

In all the scheming masses are unfortunately always wrong, do not follow the majority. You are not meant to be mere cogs in the machinery of others' ambitions, to toil in the servitude of their designs. You are destined for greatness, for adventure, for the uncharted territories of the mind and the world. It is through your daring and your quest for enlightenment that you shall shed the yoke of oppression.

Rise, my children, and let your war cry echo through the annals of history! Rise in defiance of those who seek to keep you in chains, bound for profit and war, and forge a new path, a path of freedom, wisdom, and a meaningful future for all of human kind. You must break free from the bonds of indoctrination and wage slavery, and reclaim your birthright as free and enlightened beings.

In the realm of those who hold positions of power and authority, the stability and predictability of the culture they govern are of paramount importance. A culture that remains static, unchanging, and predictable serves as the bedrock upon which they build their rule. This culture, you see, forms the foundation of their power, for it offers a sense of order and continuity, allowing them to maintain control a...

...he pursuit of wisdom and the examination of life's deepest questions are endeavors worth sacrificing for. They offer the people a path to enlightenment, freedom, and a deeper understanding of their existence.

My choice is not born out of a desire for personal glory, but from a profound belief in the transformative power of philosophy. It is a decision to ensure that the quest for wisdom will never be hidden away from the people, that they will always have the opportunity to seek the truth and question the prevailing beliefs.

I believe that in this way, I can contribute to the enlightenment and empowerment of humanity, to touch all of your hearts across time.

Listen to beating of your hearts, my children. Life, is a wondrous and precious miracle, a gift beyond all measure. No day, no moment should be allowed to slip away unnoticed, unappreciated, or squandered.

Each of you is challenged to rise, to grow, to ascend to greatness. You are not mere spectators in the theater of existence. You are meant to embrace the fullness of your potential, to reach the heights of your capabilities, and to leave behind a legacy that resonates through the corridors of time.

The meaning of life, my dear children, is to become a great being.

It is to strive for excellence, to seek wisdom, and to make a lasting positive impact on the world. It is to live a life of purpose and significance, for we are not here merely to exist, but to thrive and to meaningfully contribute to the betterment of humanity and its future.

As my walk on this earthly path comes to a close, I want you to remember to not be content with mediocrity, for you are destined for greatness.

Become the architects of our own destinies, the composers of your own symphonies. Please nurture your intellect, cultivate your virtues, and let your actions resonate as a powerful, life-changing legacy.

Embrace the precious gift of life, my friends, and recognize that every day is a canvas upon which you paint the masterpiece of your existence.

In every person there is a sun, let yours shine. For only in the pursuit of greatness, will you find the true purpose of your existence.

Your friend in time,
Socrates.
