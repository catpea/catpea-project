Above all, camping,
is the best introduction to hiking.

And you are of nature;
not, a city slicker.

You simply learned to ignore,
all the city problems.

---

Having said that,
never force or bait anyone into adventure.

People go,
when they are ready to go, or never.

---

To be safe, never camp,
where a flash flood may occur.

Camp away from old trees,
whether it is windy or not.

And camp away from fire, food,
and away from wherever trash pandas reign.

---

Know that all trouble will pass,
like it always did since ancient times.

And when you hear the call of nature,
when forests and wilderness touch you.

Go for it, for forward,
visit cities to get new narrated books...

And just keep going, forward,
never go back.

---

Bring bug repellent,
especially repellent sticks.

They look like thick,
incense, and work well.

Consider a cowboy hat, sun screen,
and aloe as well.

---

Bring narrated books along,
especially adventure books.

They will help you laugh and cry,
live and love.

Narrated books,
are the heart of early adventures.

They represent,
our intellectual inheritance.

---

Bring a saw, a cheap, mean, sharp,
hardware store saw that won't fit anywhere.

Dry wood is tough,
and green to be protected at all cost.

The axe is heavy and dangerous,
and wood for batoning not always there.

Rather than pecking at a fallen tree,
you will be able to quickly saw it.

---


One of the most important items,
are the cut proof gloves.

Out hands are delicate,
and easily hurt, please take care of them.

A deep enough cut,
will end your adventure with worry and ache.

---

Lastly, there is a technology gadget,
a satellite messenger.

A device that operates,
away from cell towers.

It can help you stay in touch.
or call for help and avoid scary situations.

Sometimes we get tired, overheated,
dehydrated, and make simple mistkes.

Staying in contact is important,
even when hiking as a group.

---

Remember, you are a creature of the starts,
an animal first.

You don't go to the woods,
you are from the woods.

The city, is dirty, dusty,
full of pollution, micro plastics and contaminated water.

Here you have toilets that have no lids,
hand blowers that spread bacteria.

At least in the woods,
you don't have to go next to a toxic/rancid person.

The worst thing that will happen,
is traumatizing some hard working ants, albeit really badly.
