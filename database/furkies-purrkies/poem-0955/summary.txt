Self Education And The Future Of Humanity
Tuesday • October 11th 2022 • 10:46:17 pm

In the beginning, we are born warriors, all right, but that is mostly good for way back when.

So we need an upgrade, our view of the world needs enhancement.

There are false enactments, some start with good intentions, but get hacked.

But none are trustworthy, because of how easily they can be warped.

Furthermore, we are a beautiful little lonesome planet, we are not meant to be a Poverty World.

Poverty is so toxic, that it makes teachers pretend to teach.

And prevents children from learning for real, in favor of pretending by memorization...

So that they can get fair grades, and a diploma, and put food on their table…

Real education, be damned.

But lack of real education, is sustaining poverty.

And poverty makes learning for real, extremely difficult.

We can’t afford to pretend to learn for a diploma, that just gets us a job.

Lack of brilliant leaders keeps Humanity, moving in circles.

It forces the world, to repeat the same mistakes, over and over.

The trustworthy cultural upgrade, that doubles to end poverty.

Is found in each Human Being, accepting the responsibility for their own education.

Reading and listening to the finest books, in the privacy of their own lives.

Books written by the most celebrated, and accomplished thinkers.

(Not reading one book, not memorizing a text book.)

But reading all the books held in high esteem, by intellectuals around the world, without anybody grading the progress.

Aside from whatever education is today wherever you are, we can help the little ones have a brighter future.

If we keep reminding them, that to grow up means to grow all the way up.

Until all, rise to become great beings.
