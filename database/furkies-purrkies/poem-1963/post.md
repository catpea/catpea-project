It is somewhat well know in the computer world, and certainly wise,
that you put WHAT YOU CAN DO, over what you wish could be done.

All the most powerful, useful and efficient inventions exist,
due to this principle, because they could exist, and often cleanly.

The most recent example that I came across is the Bootstrap Utility API,
it is perfect, it is simple, and when I asked AI for JavaScript version it used JSON.

It is so clear, that the AI didn’t need to be told,
not to make a mess, it chose to make it simple and clear.

It is wise to honor ideas, because they are clear, possible, doable,
they have a clear start and a clear end and they get the job done.

Start learning JavaScript, of which you can think as a Loving C dialect,
fro the family of C languages like ANSI C and C++.

And as you make your way towards XML you will see it is just object instantiation,
that HTML is just a useful notation for nesting HTML Elements.

And come around to CSS, which you will recognize to be good and wise,
albeit unusual, it exists along with its bells and whistles because it was possible.

Before CSS, we would put fontSize into HTML,
and with CSS, we just select a bunch of HTML and give it like styling.

And then, like a Cat being herded, you will have to come over.
To the world of reactive programming.

Though instead of memorializing RxJS, you must ask AI to make you a Signal,
with value and subscribe, and then extend it with operators, like combineLatest.

Normal programmers do not learn RxJs by looking at the Operators,
they ask AI to show the code, it is often just one or two lines of code.

And it is always clear what it does, don’t read the docs,
read the source.

---

[I just asked public AI to create RxDatabase for me][db], with per records serialization,
and CouchDB revision fields.

In just about 250 lines of code, my life transformed again,
this happens every three days, when you are a programmer.

But the rise is always profound,
it always touches your soul.

There is zero chance, zero probability here,
that someone could ever threaten you with poverty.

You know what you got,
for all the steps you have taken.

The younger you are,
the sooner you should start.

Do not wait to learn programming,
I know this is something you didn’t plan for.

May you grow all the way up, until you become a great being,
and may you neither be broken-in nor tamed - by the evil, of poverty.
