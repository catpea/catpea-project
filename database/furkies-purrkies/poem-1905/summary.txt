On Growing Up And Legacy
Monday • May 19th 2025 • 5:56:25 pm

Preface,

There is much more to life, than what you have been taught. The problem lies in, what you don’t know you have been missing. What has been denied to you without your knowledge.

But what offends me the most, is that you have been robbed of greatness. You have a duty to leave a magnificent and lasting legacy. That is what you have been cheated out of. That is what was stolen from the world.

I want you to be a hero, to rise to the highest of mountains, and to rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Don’t be angry with me. No amount of convincing, will ever have me believe that you are the shepherd’s sheep.

And should you face without a grand and lasting legacy,
I will weep, I, will, weep.

## **“Enough of Lies: A Call for the End of Religious Tyranny and the Rise of Wisdom”**

Ladies and gentlemen,
Friends of truth, foes of dogma,
Seekers of light in a darkened world—

Tonight, I rise not to comfort you, but to confront you.
Not to console, but to *expose*—to tear the sacred veil from that which has masqueraded too long as truth.

It is time—*long past time*—to speak with clarity about what has chained the human spirit for millennia.
It is not Satan. It is not sin.
It is **organized religion.**

Yes, religion—*that ancient tyranny*, that **celestial North Korea**, that factory of fear which dares to tell children that they are born wicked, but can be made "pure" if they obey.

---

Religion has not enlightened us. It has **enslaved** us.
It has preyed on every vulnerability of the human condition—
Every longing, every fear, every grief—converted into currency for power.

And what does it do with that power?
Does it heal?
No. It **punishes the curious**.
It **demonizes science**.
It **fears women**.
It **wages war in the name of peace**.
It **promises eternity but steals the present**.

---

Let me say this plainly:
No child was ever born believing in hell.
No child was born believing they must be beaten into purity, or confess sins they did not commit, or believe that questioning is a crime.

These ideas were **taught**—systematically, cruelly, and often *with a smile*.
They are not education. They are indoctrination.
They do not liberate. They **lobotomize**.

We know—because **we were those children**.

...aged, because they vote, pay taxes, raise families, or utter pious words with solemn faces. But these are not the marks of maturity. No, far from it.

True adulthood—the authentic, unassailable kind—has nothing to do with superstition, submission, or self-righteous certainty. It does not rest on the stale breath of holy books or the trembling obedience of the fearful.

**To be truly grown is to emerge from fantasy.**
To put away the comforting lies of cosmic parents and to accept, with sober courage, that this life is the only one we know. That truth matters more than tradition. That morality cannot be outsourced to invisible tyrants. That responsibility begins where illusion ends.

Those stunted by religion, those shackled by the rusted manacles of ancient dogma, often believe they are adults because they parrot authority. But in truth, they have not yet **left the nursery**. They are still waiting for divine permission to think. Still afraid of disappointing ghosts.

We are not here to mock them—we are here to **rescue them**. To hold up a mirror, and say: you are not wicked, you are simply unfinished.

For what is a grown-up, if not one who leaves the cave, sees the world in the hard light of reason, and still dares to love it? One who learns from history not to repeat its horrors. One who **leaves behind a legacy**, not of fear, but of light. A grown-up does not kneel—they build. They question. They create the scaffolding for others to climb further still.

The real grown-ups—the true titans of our species—are those who looked up at the night sky, and instead of seeing heaven, saw a universe waiting to be understood. Those who, in the face of ignorance and power, stood and spoke, and would not shut up.

They are the ones who will never die—not really. Because they placed something permanent in the mind of the world: **clarity, courage, and the spark of thought.**

If there is to be any salvation, let it come not from above, but from within. From minds unafraid to outgrow their gods. From people who finally understand that to grow up is to grow **out**—out of the old myths, the old chains, the old fears—and to step, with deliberate dignity, into the light.

That, my friends, is the work. And that is the hope.

Thank you.

(Afterword, adlib.)
