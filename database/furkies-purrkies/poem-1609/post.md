Even if we had real schools,
the very first lesson we would be taught…

Would be to search for wise books at the library,
books from which we can inherit the heights of wisdom and culture.

I disagree that there are many mountain peaks,
Humanity ought to be headed towards convergence on wisdom.

It is a single point,
from which a safer world will bloom,.

But, this is more than an abstract opinion,
this is about fairness, so that no people or cultures, are left behind.

To be left behind, and commuted to mistakes and struggles,
that were already had, is a terrible curse.

And I’ve seen it with my own eyes,
I saw how the borders of a nation, are also borders of time.

And when that is left unchecked, the false leaders, or antidepressant ghouls,
will use that to their advantage, to feed, to mark a page in history.

One mountain peak, until we all get there,
and having left bad and unwise ideas behind, bloom in unique directions.

To travel up to the height, you have to clear your day,
you have to stop following what everyone tells you to do.

And you have to walk the Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide,
you need time to think, to heal, to notice the stars again.

The Triple Crown, as it is called, takes a long time to hike,
and a lifetime, if you are going to section hike, which is also great.

These trails are more beautiful than jogging,
and hiking hardly compares to working out at the gym.

These adventures are so beautiful,
that they almost match your quest for wisdom.

In a way the two are different sides of the same coin,
nature and wisdom.

Come the Winter of your Golden Age, you will discover,
that making room for reading books was just the start.

What really made the difference,
is the books you wrote.

Your intellectual inheritance,
has been stored for you in narrated books at the library.

And hiking the great trails,
is how you both inherit the culture of great beings, and internalize their wisdom.

You are not meant to stop part way, you are meant to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.
