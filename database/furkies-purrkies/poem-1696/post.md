If you think education is not your thing,
then you have been successfully attacked.

Th only way you can undo that,
is start with the first philosophers.

Work your way up to the ideal of Knights and Valor,
and beyond to Ladies and Gentlemen.

Creatures of Letters,
the Modern Intellectual, and finally world’s true leaders.

They are the modern philosophers,
who rise to such clarity, that they don’t make mistakes.

Unless, a mistake,
is what they need.

---

All of these beautiful beings,
have left an inheritance of you.

Every last one of them,
by virtue of deliberately rising to who they became.

Knew, that eventually,
human beings will be tricked out of education.

The motive is almost always money,
there do exist false leaders that aim to hurt humanity.

And they are well known,
it is an easy piece to publish.

---

So the great beings,
wrote for you, out of love for humanity.

They document their rise,
they stored their wisdom on paper.

And to become well again,
you need to play it back.

For this you will need narrated books,
you will find those at the libray.

Not only shoudn’t you try to read text,
you also must clear your life.

To stop the propagation,
of this feeling that education is not for you.

You have never received an education,
your teachers were just pretending to teach for an easy paycheck.

They are often our first encounter,
with the men who collectivity sold the world.

---

In the state that you are in,
you are unable to even listen to a book.

Being tricked the way you were,
cause a lot of consequences to pile up.

Both the trickery and the consequences,
will be stopping you from comprehending anything.

Which is why,
we need the Appalachian Trail.

The most important thing, right now,
is that you become aware of it.

Bill Bryson, wrote a book called.
“A Walk In The Woods”, and there is a movie with Robert Redford.

You should also check online video sites,
for how the rest of us walks the trail.

You will no doubt love Bill Bryson,
which brings us to the next book.

“A Short History of Nearly Everything”,
this will show you what education is.

It will show you how science is sweet an beautiful,
and here Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

Each created a series named Cosmos,
and you should check out all episodes from the library.

---

Start with the TV shows obviously,
but as you get to the books.

You need to start practicing camping in a tent,
not hiking, unless just a few miles.

But just being out in nature in a tent,
it is only weird and scary the first couple of days.

Our ancestors, slept in the grass,
with barely a loincloth.

You’ll be fine in a tent and a sleeping bag,
with all kinds of snacks and your Narrated Books, also called Audio Books.

Camp frequently, until on one Sunday,
you won’t pack up, and won’t go back to work.

You will stay, a long while,
listening to and more importantly re-listening to your now beloved books.

---

You have been tricked,
you have been cheated.

You have been sold out,
you have been turned into a worker.

And the meaning of life,
has become stolen from you and obscured from your sight.

It is not just education and knowledge,
they took your class, wisdom, and your legacy.

You won’t come back from your camping trip,
becasue you will understand you are perfectly capable of genius.

You were getting low grades,
because the teachers were faking grade statistics.

Since they arent teaching,
they give 1/3 As, 1/3 Bs, 1/3Cs, and no matter what you did, you were a D.

They copied your grades from other classes,
that is why you always has the same grade.

---

I am going to leave you with a short note,
Reverend Robert Evans that Bryson mentioned in Short History of Nearly Everything.

The way you can easily spot a Supernova on two photographic plates,
in just about two seconds of less.

Is by crossing your eyes, the missing dot on the first plate,
will stick right out.

And through 1,500 plates,
is pure joy.

---

It is not trickery, maybe a lazy eye,
but it is my invitation for you.

Please enter the world of Philosophy,
and her daughters the Sciences.

With all the class that you inherit,
from the loveliest of the great beings you find in your adventures.

Don’t just grow,
but grow all the way up until you become a great being.

So that you leave a meaningful legacy,
that will prevent others from getting tricked the way you were.

You are meant,
to become a Great Being.
