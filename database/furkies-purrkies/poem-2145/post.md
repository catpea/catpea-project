Well, just by looking at everyone at the gym,
you can tell that something is wrong.

Because people copy bodybuilders from movies and books,
but they don’t look like bodybuilder and show no little results.

That is because, people aren’t actually exercising,
they are just cutting off their circulation, or something like it.

By lifting too heavy they are cutting their exercise up,
multiple snippets of few lifts and a shutdown.

Cutting of your circulation,
is not exercise, it is the opposite of exercise.

But it gets worse, because muscle isolation,
be it by machine, bench, sitting or posture.

Sabotages your effort, forcing you away from a full body workout,
to a four muscle workout, if you are lucky.

How could this have happened,
and I think the answer is two gold.

It feels good to look like you are working out,
if is nice to stop frequently, and routines are hard to break.

Getting used to one kind of a workout,
drives your stay, and maybe your day.

It is a disaster, and to add suspicion,
no one seems to be speaking out against this set-and-rep abomination.

Bodybuilding is the simplest thing in the world,
you do it as a baby as you develop muscles to walk and run.

Childhood obesity,
develops muscles to carry the extra fat.

There are many litter wisdoms,
that can describe a good workout strategy.

“Lift light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and never lift so heavy that you are forces to stop" is my favorite.

Followed by, “It is not how heavy you lift,
but how long you lift your heavy for”

But bodybuilding,
can be described in a singe paragraph.

It starts as aerobics with light weights for an hour,
and when your body adapts to the challenge you add more weight.

The picture of aerobics you should imagine,
is the 1980/90 big hair, bright neon and spandex aerobic dance workout.

And just as soon as you are able to dance through the hour,
non stop with 5 lb per hand you go up by 2.5 lb, no more, and repeat.

By the time you get to dancing with almost 20lb per hand,
for two or three hours, you move slow, it looks like lifting, almost.

But your body is all big muscle,
because you kept getting it to adapt, without jumping to far ahead.

And that initial hour of non stop motion,
is covered by just learning to jog for an hour.

Jogging for one hour and dancing with dumbbells,
are very much interchangeable.

---

Do you see what a disaster it is, people aren’t exercising,
they have snippets of exercise cut up by lifting to heavy.

And then there is always some advice giver,
that proclaims aerobics is the opposite of bodybuilding.

And then proceeds to spend years doing it wrong,
thus proving him self wrong in the worst way, by showing no results.

---

Come to the gym and start dancing with dumbbells,
once you get flexible there are no aches.

And light weights, will never, ever hurt you,
and lifting to music, one beat up, next beat down, makes time fly.

You get to dress like wrestles and superheros,
and dance like a maniac.

A astronauts, or even a leg in a plaster cast teach us,
muscles are temporary, they come and go as they see fit.

An active lifestyle will extend your youth and life,
in ways that nothing else can.

May you forever stay,
a spring chicken.
