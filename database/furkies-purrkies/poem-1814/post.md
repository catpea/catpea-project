As your kitten spends more time with you,
it will want to become more like you

That is why it sits on the keyboard,
sleeps long hours and looks bored.

And what zoomies are about,
they show that your kitten also works hard.

---

But to truly become bestest best friends,
you have to help their confidence.

Because there is one thing you kitten cannot do,
and that is to _look_ more like you.

You see, your kitten is aware.
that it has fur but does not have hair.

Buy some small wigs and a hat or two,
and your kitten will trull appreciate you.

You may also get some colorful clothes,
but not all kittens like wearing those.

---

Now your kitten will walk around your house,
looking proud, like it just caught a mouse...

---

There are three more things that you can do,
to show your kitten that you love them true.

---

To fully entrain your kitty,
build them a vast cardboard city.

With high-rises that reach up to the windows,
to help them watch the birds up close.

---

And then get another kitty,
so that they can both live in their city.

And build them a fancy cardboard house,
to have a place for their zoomies and meows,

---

And finally, help them be more discreet,
by teaching them to use the toilet seat.

Just put the cat box on top as a trigger,
cut out a little hole, and make it bigger and bigger.

So that eventually your cats can just hop,
and make their deuces... plop.
