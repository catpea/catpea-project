Lawn Flurries

Captain's Log: Day Fourteen of Quarantine,

All the local squirrels, now hold me in high esteem.

They feel munchies to extreme,

but the trailmix they stole is gone,

flurries of the box still scattered on my lawn.

Squirrels, now crazed, and withdrawn.

Peanuts on their mind,

because mail delivery was ill timed.

(Why am I like this?)
