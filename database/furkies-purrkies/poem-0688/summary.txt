A Letter To All Human Beings
Monday • January 17th 2022 • 5:04:48 pm

We face many problems,\
that unfortunately can't be fixed.

We can't bring back tigers after they are gone,\
we can't do anything after a Nuclear War.

We can't remove corruption from politics,\
because it permeates it, because it is politics.

While these problems have no solutions,\
there is something gentle, wise and wonderful that can be done.

---

The irreparable can be prevented from occurring,\
the events leading up to disasters **can be** collapsed.

---

There are two powerful measures that people of the world must institute,\
Real Schools, and A Poverty Ending Bank.

---

The bank does not make a person rich,\
the money is only meant for food and savings.

$100 dollars per day in 2020 money,\
constantly adjusted for inflation.

There are ways to ensure one card per person,\
but card fraud does not matter, only that we take care of the poor matters.

You send in a piece of paper, even if you can't write, a squiggle will do,\
you get a card with your mark back.

Card is reset to $100 at Midnight Greenwich Mean Time,\
everyone gets to eat, and set money aside for rent.

All humans beings will be approved,\
no exceptions.

The bank is a simple computer program,\
it does not track debt past 24 hours, it just resets the cards to $100 dollars at Midnight GMT.

It is just an international institution,\
it is not part of any country in particular.

---

Critics, please understand,\
and understand for what you stand for.

I leave it up to Philosophers to plow the depths of this crime,\
and bring light to the misery we all spread by accepting Poverty as part of life.

---

Schools have never worked,\
any and all the success that was had came from well educated parents, tutors, well to do families, generational wealth, and luck.

The year is 2022,\
and we still don't have schools.

There is a handful of educational institutions that function under the disuse of serving the gifted,\
they may in fact function, but the idea is to charge more for special kind of education.

In that way,\
all our educational institutions engage in fraud.

---

Much like the international bank,\
an international school, independent of any nation is needed.

It will produce a program much like MediaWiki that powers WikiPedia,\
but it will function as a game where u...

...o such a thing as to hang on to them.

---

Our minds are not in the right place,\
we have been mislead for far too long.

But all it takes to see that school is not working,\
is looking back at our experiences in high school.

And all it takes to see that we are wage slaves,\
is to imagine a life with a $100 per day card.

I know it is a bit scary, but just consider what you have given up of your self,\
for this stupid idea that we are all meant to be poor, that this is how things are meant to be, for reasons too complex for our simple minds to grasp.

---

Help your children understand that their poverty is neither your or their fault,\
that it is a mistake that humanity has made while growing up.

With each grade remind them that schools are the worst form of education,\
and that they are little more than training for a life in which one is drained of mental health, strength, and bodily health, just to be replaced by a new hire.

Just like companies will lower pay and increase workload, like store will increase prices and lower quality,\
schools will decrease knowledge and encourage memorization because on paper knowledge and temporary memorization looks the same, and thus everyone gets paid just the same.

---

Help your children understand,\
that Poverty is an Error, and Schools never worked past the first few years.

Tell them that even so,\
they are still charged with becoming Great Beings, and that must never change.

---

Addendum.

The following is a slightly longer list of directions,\
that the student can choose in the new schools.

Each direction branches out to more related directions,\
they don't just create a single line, but more of a mesh of interests.

Adventurer, Intellectual, Humanitarian, Philosopher, 3d Printer, Psychologist, Evolutionary Biologist,\
Survivalist, Drone Operator, Astronomer, Antiquarian, Meteorite Hunter, Archaeologist, Industrial Designer,\
Designer, Slackliner, Trainer, Surfer, Athlete, Maker, Blacksmith, Jeweler, Electrical Engineer,\
Tracker Musician, Composer, Music Theorist, Dancer, Slam Poet, Interactive Fiction Writer, Sculptor,\
Generative Artist, Graphician, Digital Painter, Mathematician, Hacker, Programmer, Web Developer,\
Privacy Advocate, Security Analyst, Cryptographer, Reverse Engineer.
