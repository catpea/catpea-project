In the beginning we discover our Universal Self,

the Being we are, regardless, of what Culture or Place we are born into.

Then we set an aim, by asking our Elder Selves what heir regrets are,

the more we advance forward the more we become Ourselves.

The less regrets our Elder Selves have,

the more we become in harmony with ourselves.

The Way Of The Warrior, is a self correcting path,

each time we advance we become stronger, wiser, and more powerful.

Frame after frame, as time ticks away, and our minds and bodies grow,

we near, and finally become; our Elder Selves.

We arrive with Certainty of Knowing that the path we traveled was our own,

that we are in Harmony with Universe, that all our Senses are Finely Tuned.

In moving forward we don't need to ask what life is for,

Life is for the Living, for those who grow and advance forward.

There cannot be any real regrets as we had decades to avoid them,

and whatever obstacles there were, we never lost our way.

The Final Aim, is to rise all the way up, and become a Great Being,

to build a legacy of Wisdom and Good Ideas, Lessons Worth Sharing, and Moving Inspiration.
