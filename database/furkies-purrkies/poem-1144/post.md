Programming is not just a tool for creating computer programs,
computer code is a way to uniformly represent complex things.

[Math as code][1] is a powerful example of that,
here mathematical notation ceases to be ambiguous.

Programming is also self evaluating,
here infective teachers can’t tweak grades to keep under the radar.

They may not even be necessary,
certainly grades aren’t.

Here the program either works,
or needs more work.

Of course standardized education,
would try to force standardized programs.

And that can’t work,
it never did.

For example forcing students to read books they aren’t interested in,
and then grading them, has forever been profoundly stupid.

Doing the same with computer programs,
would fail just as badly.

But if the students were to choose,
what they want to study with code.

In a self paced, self directed education,
they could map out, and thus learn about anything.

They can simulate how the body works to study medicine,
or flat out write a computer game to study math and physics.

This is easy and realistic,
so as long as they are choosing what to learn next.

Some students may choose building content management systems,
others payment processing systems.

These are not traditional subjects,
but having pursued unique subject for years…

Will log a menigful history of curiosities,
achievements, and research interests.

Which is far more valuabe than an ineffective-High-School diploma,
and could create a culture of creating small companies.

Helping students to lift themselves out of poverty,
rather than pushing them into student debt...

Under the promise of higher education,
which is equally inefective.

This is not just about education,
it is about putting an end to wars and shortsightedness.

I think the truth is,
that we only tell ourselves that wars have clear reasons.

And in fact they are started by uneducated mad men,
for no logical reason at all.

It wasn’t the archduke, or some fantasy of superiority,
and the war that is currently ongoing could be just the result of mix of drugs or  antidepressants.

We want there to be a reason,
but there are only the conditions that lead to this failure.

And I think that infective education,
plays a dominant role here.

And we can be certain, that in real education,
great and brilliant beings would always rise and never sink to wars.

In fact real education,
prevents wars.

Schools that don’t care if the student understands or memorizes,
so as long as they pass the test, and move on.

Schools that merely sell an impression of education,
that simulate hard work with meaningless, uninteresting and irrelevant tests…

Are not a question of “a least teaching the student a little bit”,
but about replacing real education with a mere semblance of one.

At the price of peace, and denying the future generations,
the future that is worthy of them.

I think it is time for the world to understand,
that standardized education is irrelevant and ineffective education.

Students require an education that addresses their personal curiosities,
without punishment of bad grades, of threats of being held back.

Or the most insane one them all, the threat of living in the streets,
unless they take out college loans, that can’t even be forgiven by bankruptcy.

We must remember that true human culture or our super culture,
the one that encompasses all other cultures,

Has been beautifully framed by Philosophers,
and Great Beings that made meaningful, and lasting contributions.

And that should be the aim of real education,
the entry, into the Culture of Greatness and Great Thoughts, and Great Deeds.
