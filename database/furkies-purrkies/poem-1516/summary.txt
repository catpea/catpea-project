The Great Michigan Ice Age
Friday • April 26th 2024 • 12:42:54 am

It has been months since the year started,
we had a few warm days…

But overall,
it seems to be getting colder.

This can only mean one thing,
Michigan, is slowly entering a new ice age.

---

Last Michigan ice age,
was just 12,000 years ago.

And it was a doozie,
it not only carved the Great Lakes…

But dropped the great,
and magnificent 300 pound beavers.

---

Little is known,
about the early Michiganders.

Though we can be sure,
they ate most of the beavers.

Some still roam the Michigan woods,
moonlighting as the Sasquatch.

And had a great sense of humor,
because they stuck around in the cranky weather.

---

Michigan is not prepared for a new ice age,
certainly the roads won't handle it well

But I personally see the new Ice Age,
as a hard invitation to spend more time with nature.

While I only got to visit [Nordhouse Dunes][0],
which is as beautiful and mystical as it sounds.

I have met other hikers and bicyclists,
who mentioned the 2,000 mile [Iron Belle Trail][1].

And the more complete 1180 mile,
[North Country Trail][2].

Michigan has a lot of woods, state parks,
trails, and shoreline trails and beaches.

In the age of overwork, the couch potatos,
the kinds of people whose ancestors ate all the beavers.

Can really use long nature trails,
to get back in shape, to get buff...

To wrestle some Sasquatch,
and sink their teeth in giant beaver jerky.
