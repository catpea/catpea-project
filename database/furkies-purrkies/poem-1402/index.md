“Live life in such a way, that strangers, will accuse you,
of having fever dreams, and demand you get help.”

– Abraham Gol Diddly Damn Lincoln.

We don’t have Strong Artificial Intelligence yet,
and we may struggle with one that can improve it self, for a long time.

What we have today, is called a Large Language Model,
it is a chaos of rivers, through which countless human ideas have ran.

The flow carved impressions in a virtual space,
and a kind of intelligence emerged by re-flowing through the carved valleys.

It is an Artificial Intelligence, based on a copy of us,
it will forever be useful.

The appropriate reaction to any kind of artificial intelligence,
is just to use it, [preferably a free open source version of it][1].

Do not cut yourself away from it,
do not shut it off, shun it, because it is not just the future, but your future as well.

Nor is this a matter of inconvenience of learning or adapting to new things,
it is a matter of becoming more capable, smarter and swifter.

If you are still young, you need to be aware of the great many mistakes,
humanity has made.

If you live in a large city, there are inter continental ballistic missiles pointed at I it,
if a mandatory draft is declared, you will be shipped of to a nuclear war.

Forced indoctrination into fantasies that include imaginary creatures,
and ineffective education where cramming is considered knowing, at play as well.

You will have to learn how to use the AI, and prepare for the future,
and you should learn with an eye on side-projects of tiny businesses.

Where you can sell software, designs, even computer programs,
learning programming is very important now.

I don’t want to be accused of more AI fever dreams,
so let me explain something important.

You can ask the AI, to create new fashion,
animal hoodies, superhero leather jackets, and fancy dresses.

This used to be very difficult,
but now, you need to open a store where you sell those designs.

And tillable fabric patterns,
and hats, don’t forget historian hats and superhero capes.

You can do interior design the same way,
you can even attach some photos to make the results more familiar.

You can ask AI, to design some neat web pages for you,
and then take the colors and sell some HTML themes.

UI Kits are really nice too,
especially if you provide matching SVG graphics, as well.

Bonus if you animate them,
easy for SVG/s.

But the experience, and knowledge, and problem solving,
are the most precious items here.

And that is the thing about AI,
it gets you into new worlds, and helps you learn inside out.

Finally, AI is an invitation to the world of programming,
where you can transmute thoughts into real world creations.

At the snap of fingers, at the tip of your hat,
and I mean a hat you audaciously designed and had manufactured.

The word has changed in 23,
the rules are different now.

People who worked hard at non AI creations will be angry,
but that just how progress works.

Angry old people,
yelling at the clouds.
