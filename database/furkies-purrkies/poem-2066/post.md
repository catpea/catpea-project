I don't know much about Med School,
but I know much about programming, so hear me out.

I have long had a suspicion that programming,
is the only powerful approach to authentic education.

In conspiratorial terms, just to get your attention,
“They are not teaching you coding to stop you from learning.”

The foremost problem with this notion is that,
if you want to go to med school programming will do little for you.

The correct way to solve this, is to understand,
that you can easily memorize human anatomy by becoming an artist.

Creating you own Codex Leicester,
will not only make a precious keepsake, but build a memory palace.

Programming, goes beyond pencils and paper,
you can make games, simulations, and visualizations.

And not only memorize hierarchies,
but sequences, processes, interactions, and mechanisms.

You can model how neurons fire in networks,
how the heart’s electrical system maintains rhythm.

Or how enzymes catalyze reactions,
in cascades.

You could simulate blood flow through arteries,
how drugs bind to receptors and alter pathways.

Even complex phenomena,
immune responses, gene regulation.

I have ended the programming won’t help you with med-school argument,
it will make you more than you can imagine today.

But that was before AI, that was the primitive answer,
the one that challenged you to more side education.

Today, with the power of AI,
your programming education is not a support system.

It is the heart of your education,
the heart of the greatness of your knowledge.

The crucible of transcendence,
the flame of invention.

This has nothing to do with Computational Biology,
this is just what learning programming does for you.

---

I will now briefly describe evidence of how artificial intelligence,
enhances and greatly accelerates your programming education.

I will use a quick example from my own world,
where I am learning something new about programming.

I am designing a program that converts text, audio and even video,
on inexpensive low powered computers.

My target computer reports 4 CPUs, at 1800 MHz
my 15 year old desktop by contrast has 8 CPUs at 4000 Mhz.

To be precise, both computers have a single chip,
that feature multiple cores.

The core approach is cheaper to manufacture,
and more energy efficient.

As a result modern programming requires,
that you write code that does not just directly execute.

But instead creates a small program,
that will be sent for execution on one of the available CPUs.

You can no longer write instructions in a single column,
you now have to create tasks called threads that execute on a CPU core.

I’ve been using a singe core thus far,
because I was analyzing requirements for my programs.

But now time came to stop executing code,
and instead send tasks up for execution.

I work with node.js,
as it allows me to write for multiple operating systems.

And I can execute my programs on a web page,
which is to say client computer.

Or a proper network server,
where many tasks from many users can be handled.

---

My ultimate aim, as you might have guesses already,
is to write a program that uses users browsers as threads.

Where I can just point some computers at a web page,
and speed up task processing, such as video encoding.

This can really help an inexpensive computer,
complete intensive tasks.

But for now, I am practicing the crafting of an architecture,
that looks like a single CPU program, but uses multiple cores.

Best of both worlds,
for that I need [node.js worker threads][1].

But I used AI to double check, I asked a plain question,
how can I make use of all my CPUS in a node.js appliciaon.

And I explained that I am building a blog engine,
AI responded with “[High-Performance Static Site Generator Strategies for Node.js v25][2]”

Which is a small mix of 3rd party libraries that simplify node.js,
and wonderful explanations of latest efficient patterns.

You would ask a similar question about your programming projects,
receiving not just links, but complete code snippets.

I tend to avoid 3rd party libraries,
as they pose some security risks…

So I asked a follow up question:
“I like the Native Worker Threads without external libraries. Can you show me a pattern where I do many kinds of different operations? creating html files, but but also copying files, processing images, etc…”

AI responded with:
“[Native Worker Threads Pattern for Multiple Operations,
Here's a comprehensive pattern for handling different operations (HTML generation, file copying, asset optimization, etc.) using native Worker Threads][3]”

---

This may sound like an ordinary thing,
but this is a modern miracle.

A miracle, that turned some of the best AI researchers,
into futuristic “theorists”.

And even I often feel the pressure to ramble,
about AI, but I assure you I am not rambling here.

---

This miracle, is real, is about taking worker_threads,
and placing it, in your context, in what you are programming.

Worker threads are confusing,
but not when AI shows you how to address your needs.

Now, simultaneous processing, worker pools,
task queues, are not on your reading list.

But, are attached to your programming needs,
where you can see where everything is supposed to go.

Think of my requirements as a skeleton,
the AI adds the organs, vessels, and connective tissue.

Worker threads become neurons transmitting impulses in parallel, while queues act as the bloodstream carrying resources to where they’re needed.

Task schedulers behave like the autonomic nervous system, regulating flow without conscious control.

Shared memory resembles inter-cellular signaling, while synchronization barriers act like membranes ensuring proper exchange.

The miracle is in AI locating the correct programming patterns,
and transforming them into your needs.

So that you are now able, to now figure out,
where everything goes.

From needs and context, and program requirements,
that you yourself have set, and will have trouble recognizing.

---

Lastly, I want to show you how I did this decades ago,
I would learn languages, by rewriting a popular email script.

I would bring the context of the [FormMail][4] script,
and search documentation of a new language I was learning.

On how the things that FormMail Does,
are accomplished in the new language I was learning.

The more languages I learned,
the faster I learned new languages.

---

What you have today, is so much superior,
that it is foolish not to take a break from school and learn programming.

There is much more to this,
I already mentioned Computational Biology…

But to close, it will suffice to say, AI will not take your job,
is you are able to conduct a symphony orchestra with its powers.
