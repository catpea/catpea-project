High School does not teach very much,\
but it is going to be OK so as long as you learn on your own.

And if you are still looking for a direction,\
[consider creating a mighty industrial design portfolio](https://www.coroflot.com/designers/most-followers), use [Blender](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Blender+Tutorial) and [Ender](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ender+3+v2+assembly) to learn 3D Modeling, Printing, and real product design.

Learning on your own is always about the next complex cluster of things,\
that you find interesting.

Examples of a couple of clusters that I like are,\
Computer Generated Art and Programming, Electronics + DIY Flying Drones and possibly programming them as well, and Learning art and color mixing with the use of Office Projectors.

Clusters are always friendly, they are full of color, and you never memorize, ever,\
and each cluster is incredibly fascinating.

Don’t expect a school that takes money from you to teach you anything,\
and don’t let anybody tell you what to learn, as that is a fake education.

It takes us a long time to build up the roads, and connect the dots,\
to get into a cluster of subjects that we can be passionate about,

Being force fed information via a standardized curriculum or lecture plan,\
is an unbelievable insult, it is fraud, and it is rage worthy.

[Something went wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts),\
[the adults of some authority go bonkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOSgnL6cZ4I).

[But as long as you learn for real be it failure or triumph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hLMOVBzz2o),\
[you will do well](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+startup).

It was always kind of silly to think that somebody else will give you,\
a job, money, home, health, happiness, and perfect life - in a world of tricksters and liars.

And it is so much more meaningful, to do it yourself,\
that all those lies don’t even mater.

But don’t allow yourself to just believe in what people are telling you, including me,\
all the observations, and promises that people are making, require proper evidence.

Evidence, results, history, firm and angry science,\
is how you get the raw facts.

You should also look at success of self education,\
and [try to understand what Duncan Campbell teachers us about the so called F students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK2OPkz2LTM).

[Sir Ken Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sir+Ken+Robinson) says that schools are killing creativity,\
and Campbell proves at least to me that the only failures are the teachers.

---

In a way we don’t even need proof,\
it is the risk of ineffective education alone, that is all the argument we need to take to self education.

What we know influences the decisions we make,\
those in turn influence all the life ahead of us.

It is too risky to trust the teachers,\
it is better to accept the responsibility for our own education.

Which is why you need a laboratory,\
with Learn Electronics Kits, Soldering Irons and Soldering Iron Accessories.

It is why you need a 3D printer with an auto-bed-leveling kit, and few glass surfaces that you can swap out instead of waiting for the print to cool off,\
and a mountain of PLA filament along with a little $10 baggie of extrudes so that you never run out.

You will need an office projector, connected to a laptop, so that you can play around with the brightness contrast slider while you are projecting on the canvas,\
and you need frames that match your canvas for when you feel like exhibiting your art.

A good computer for programming is also very important,\
make sure you have a fancy keyboard, and master p5js as soon as possible.

And, of course you have to master saying,\
"[Deedee, get out of my laboratory!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42wR9udglI8)"
