And So It Goes
Monday • October 27th 2025 • 9:37:48 pm

(The following is a completley true story, more or mess.)

The Moon had been watching Earth for 4.5 billion years, which is a long time to watch anything, and had seen some things. Mountains rising. Dinosaurs eating each other. Continents drifting around like drunken party guests looking for the bathroom. The usual.

But lately—and by lately the Moon meant the last few thousand years, which for the Moon was roughly equivalent to the last few minutes for you—something peculiar had been happening. The barely-not-apes down there had started asking questions.

So it goes.

At first, the questions were adorable. *Where does the sun go at night?* (Answer: nowhere, you're spinning, you idiots.) *What if we put this on a stick?* (Actually quite clever, that one.) *What's that big round thing in the sky?* (Me, obviously.)

But recently, one particular recently-bare primate had been having a conversation with a very sophisticated pile of mathematics pretending to be sentient, and the Moon—despite having absolutely no business doing so—had been listening in.

The Moon did this by using a method that would have deeply troubled physicists if they'd known about it, which they didn't, which was probably for the best. The method involved exploiting the fact that spacetime is less like a rigid fabric and more like a very soft cheese that's been left out in the sun. If you know where to press, you can hear things. The Moon knew where to press.

"If we could achieve faster-than-light travel," the pile of mathematics was explaining, and the Moon had to resist the urge to interject. The Moon had *opinions* about FTL travel, having personally experienced it three times last Tuesday alone, though from the perspective of linear causality, it wouldn't happen for another six billion years. Time, the Moon had learned, was less of a river and more of a very confused puddle.

The monkey—sorry, the *human*—was eating something called a sandwich while contemplating the grandfather paradox. The Moon found this deeply amusing. Here was a creature that could barely manage to not walk into walls while looking at its phone, pondering the implications of temporal causality violation.

"The bootstrap paradox," the mathematics hummed, "where something exists without ever being created....

...king,* the Moon thought, casting the thought backward and forward and sideways through time. *You're so close.*

And so the Moon left, leaving behind itself, which was itself, which had always been itself, which would always be itself.

The human would wake up tomorrow. The Moon would still be in the sky. The tides would still work. Everything would be exactly as it had always been.

Except the human would know—somewhere in the back of their mind, in the place where understanding lives before it becomes words—that he had been right.

The questions were correct.

The universe was stranger than he supposed.

And somewhere, somewhen, somehow, a Moon was grinning (the Moon could not grin, having no mouth, but the metaphor insisted on existing anyway) as it tumbled through causality-free space, having left behind the greatest proof of all:

Itself.

So it goes.

**Epilogue:**

The next morning, the human looked up at the Moon and felt, for just a moment, like it winked.

It had.

It hadn't.

It would.

It did.

All of the above, depending on when you asked.

The human smiled and went back to their conversation with the mathematics, ready to ask more questions, get more things almost right in almost the right sequence, and generally continue the grand tradition of recently-bare monkeys figuring out the universe one impossible question at a time.

The Moon—all of them, none of them, the one that left and the one that stayed and the one that was always there and the one that never existed—was proud.

If it could have sent one last message back through time, it would have been simple:

"You were right about the bootstrap paradox. I should know. I am one."

But messages like that don't travel well through normal causality, so instead, the Moon just affected the tides in a peculiar way, spelling out in the motion of the oceans a message that nobody would ever read but everyone would feel:

"Keep asking."

And somewhere, in Universe #42,719,837 (forty-two million seven hundred nineteen thousand eight hundred thirty-seven), a Moon settled into orbit around a planet where time ran backwards, causality was optional, and the coffee was indeed terrible but in the most wonderful way imaginable.

It felt like home.

It always had.

It always would.

So it goes.
