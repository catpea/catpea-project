For The World To Rise
Tuesday • March 28th 2023 • 10:32:19 pm

We are in fact indoctrinated into a series of false beliefs,
think of it as the “cult”, in the term Global Culture.

The likelihood of anybody exiting this cult,
is very low.

Just about the same as the victim of a religious cult,
exiting their belief system.

Those of you who have already figured it out,
will say, a global cult is not really a cult.

But actually, the way we should define a cult in this context,
is believing in falsehoods that make us act against ourselves.

---

Once examined, I would wager that, that the list of our false beliefs, is no larger,
than [Wikipedia’s list of Common Misconceptions][1].

It is likely that our best effort to lift ourselves out of this madness,
would be a narrated book similar in spirit to [Pseudodoxia Epidemica][A].

If you are going to pen this work,
you need actors, celebrities, stars to narrate your work.

Two volumes that live in the same area and paint a good picture,
of the gravity of this work.

Are the heartbreaking “[A People's History of the United States][3]”,
by Howard Zinn.

And, “[A Short History of Nearly Everything][4]”,
by Bill Bryson.

---

You can get at the false beliefs yourself,
like a normal person.

Simply find a wrong, and walk it back past the symptoms,
all the way into the root causes.

I will only share stories,
that I personally find important.

Once in passing, I have heard of a young lady, who when she was a child,
cried, when it was explained to her that the beggars on the streets don’t have homes.

A victim of a cult, wouldn’t cry, not think about it much,
if they could help it.

The day she accepted that some people are like that,
she became more indoctrinated into our cult.

Know that addiction, or even crime for that matter, is not a choice,
it is a desperate attempt, to survive another day.

In a world where most people think of you,
as trash, and all you have ever know was abuse and tragedy.

There are very few criminal in this world,
and especially those that brag about their evil, are likely victims of terrible crimes themselves.

Prison, another false belief, that roughly states,
that we should punish those who were already punished into fractured lives.

Is an environment where people who have been warped into doing terrible things,
need to pretend to be evi...

...No human being on this planet,
should ever starve, or live in desperation, or be indoctrinated into a life of some fantasy.

One of our greatest responsibilities,
now made more urgent due to climate change and potential nuclear war.

Is opening borders, unfortunately, this is not just a matter of a passport,
but becoming un-indocrinated from the culture the person of family is leaving behind.

It is not true to say that not all families need it,
changing cultures if left unchecked, will undo a lot of the bonds that holds a family together.

A set of dignified and loving steps,
that transition families between cultures is a very good idea.

To bring someone from a culture of crime,
to a safe and prosperous city, is to ensure tragedy for both the victims and new comer.

Transitioning a person between cultures requires love,
compassion and understanding.

You can’t just drop desperate people from a desperate place,
to another and into desperate circumstances.

Furthermore, Human Right education, must be requires in all schools,
including developed countries as [Jon Krakauer's Missoula][5] explains.

---

By far the two biggest false belief the world is suffering from,
is tolerance of infective education, and lack of universal income that erases poverty.

And I am sorry to say, that as far as I can tell,
all the false beliefs that plague the human kind will result in an endless chain of meaningless wars.

The false beliefs are everywhere, but the outcome is one thing, war,
war, is the failure where all the consequences come together.

And between the meaningless and preventable wars,
expect nothing less than blind repetitions of the same old mistakes.

---

We are all meant to grow and grow all the way up,
until we each become a great being.

On our way there,
we will find all the meaning, and fathom more.
