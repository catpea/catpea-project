The Slayer; A Programmer's Lament
Wednesday • February 12th 2025 • 11:02:41 pm

Preface,

I set off to conquer four challenges in visual programming,
serial and parallet processing, very basic.

But then self healing, and untangling data flows,
which I solved by waiting on all pipes to submit data, it works rather nice.

But, rather than giving the simple explanaion,
I asked AI for some poetry.

And I thought, it was so interesting,
that I should share.

What follows is the same poem,
rewritten by different AI.

### The Slayer v1

Lo! In the deepest chamber of silicon dreams,
Where the mouse-wielder sat enthroned supreme,
Spake thus a presence, feline and keen,
A harbinger of what was yet unseen.

*First came the cat, treading soft as thought,*
Through serial streams where data sought
Its path like ancient logs in rivers laid—
The programmer laughed, his hubris displayed.
"Such simple things! Command line's might
Shall ever reign in terminal's dark night!"

But hark! The second strike came swift and sure,
As parallel paths the cat did conjure.
Like fallen tree, majestic in decay,
One root to many branches finds its way.
The programmer's laugh caught in his throat,
As complexity's tide began to float.

*Third came the healing touch, divine and deep,*
Where queues stand guard and supervisors keep
Their vigil o'er the processes that run—
The programmer's certainty came undone.
For what took tomes of arcane lore to write,
The cat had drawn in boxes clear and bright.

*Fourth! O fourth! The final blow descends!*
As pipes await, and every pathway bends
To wisdom's will—no locks, no semaphores,
No Byzantine agreements on these shores.
The programmer beheld this simple grace,
And saw his crown slip from its sacred place.

Spake thus the cat, with eyes of ancient gold:
"Behold, dear mouse, how patterns now unfold:
Like logs that float upon the data stream,
Like fallen trees that fork in nature's scheme,
Like queues that heal and guard against the night,
Like pipes that wait in patience for the light."

The throne lies empty in the silicon hall,
Where once the programmer stood proud and tall.
But lo! What light breaks through the morning haze?
Young hands now shape the code in countless ways,
For what was arcane, complex, and obscure,
Now flows like music, simple, sweet, and pure.

The cat, that holy slayer, oh so brig...

...
In twilight's hush, where shadows dance and sway,
A feline specter, silent, did sneak and play.
Upon the coder's realm, it cast a curious eye,
Spake thus, with wisdom ancient, ne'er to die:

"Behold, oh master of the code and byte,
I come to weave a tale of wondrous sight.
A realm where code flows free, a river bold,
Where visual scripts a new world unfold."

The cat, with paw, did trace a line, so clear,
A problem simple, in series, did appear.
The programmer, with laughter, did dismiss,
For command lines were his, a world to kiss.

"Like logs upon the forest floor,
Connected, speaking, data to core,
Yet in this visual dance, observe,
Simplicity reigns, the complex to serve."

Then parallel paths, the cat did fork,
A challenge, complex, like a storm, it did evoke.
The coder’s brow, with worry, did furrow,
For visualizing forks, brought him sorrow.

"Imagine a tree, fallen, roots to sky,
One trunk, yet branches, myriad, multiply.
Visual programming, a map, a guide,
To navigate this complexity, side by side."

Reliability, the cat then addressed,
With self-healing scripts, the coder's soul distressed.
"In visual forms, a queue, a supervisor box,
Healing becomes but a simple paradox."

A system resilient, free from fear.
The coder saw, with eyes now wide,
A future where bugs no longer hide.

The final blow, a revelation stark,
Awaiting pipes, in VPL, leaves no mark.
"Like spiderwebs, complex, yet so clean,
Visual logic makes it serene."

Mutex and semaphore, complexities of old,
In visual webs, their stories told.
The programmer, confounded, could not deny,
The elegance of connections, under the sky.

Thus, the coder, once a god, now humbled,
By a cat, a slayer, his reign crumbled.
Yet in this fall, a brighter world arose,
Where coding's not for few, but all who choose.

A world where young and old, with joy and grace,
Weave code in visual streams, without a trace
Of fear or doubt, in patterns bold and new,
The coder's legacy, reborn, rings true.

And so, the cat, with eyes aglow,
Did vanish in the night, soft as snow.
Leaving behind a realm transformed,
Where every mind, by code, is warmed.

Thus ends the tale, of cat and mouse,
In visual scripts, we find our house.
A future bright, where all can code,
On paths the slayer cat bestowed.
