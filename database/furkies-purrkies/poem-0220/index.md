Once, late at night,

I was prancing in the moonlight.

Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,

and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.

---

There was an occasional bark or a howl,

but it didn't get scary till I heard an owl.

"Hoot, hoot" - she said,

"I am about to swoop down and peck y'all dead."

---

"No, thank you Dear Madam", I sweetly replied,

as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.

"Hoot, hoot" - I heard,

to which I yelled now at a gallop "I ain't afraid of no bird."

---

"Hoot, hoot" - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,

squirting urine at every step.

And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,

and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.

---

I was lucky, and my camp was near,

legend has it that she's still out there filling the woods with fear.

So if if you're ever out there, and hear a hoot,

better grab onto your butt, and scoot.
