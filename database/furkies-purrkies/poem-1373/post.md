All you need to do to become a programmer,
is pick a language and search for tutorials.

Before choosing a language, consider friendliness, popularity,
and what other languages it will take you to.

The friendliest languages do not force you,
to define your variables, they just let you program and flow.

Many programmers think that a strongly typed language like C or C++
is much better than then the more flexible language like JavaScript.

But JavaScript is the language behind all the web pages,
and when you pick a language other than JavaScript.

You will still have to learn it, to make things work on the internet,
so it is like the internet is encouraging you to learn JavaScript first.

And JavaScript can work on the server with nodejs,
create desktop applications with electron, and even mobile apps.

In all cases, you write one program,
and then it works on all the operating systems, or all phone types.

With other languages, you can’t write for the web,
you are stuck on server, desktop, or mobile.

And often you will need to rewrite your application,
for multiple operating systems.

JavaScript will seem bulky,
and it is easy to call it slow.

But in other languages programmers spend years,
reinventing things that JavaScript already comes with for free.

They just learned the wrong programming language to start with,
and now they are cranky.

You will be glad to know that becoming a Great and Powerful programmer,
is just about also the silliest and sweetest thing in the world.

Programmers will tell you that,
learning programming is hard work.

But that is in an inside joke,
there is much more to it.

And here I reveal the secret,
so you better sit down, and grab onto something…

Or just grab you know,
grab your butt, as that will also work.

Hard work, is involved, but only to tire yourself out,
to then after a few days, take an incredible nap.

That is right, the secret of great programmers,
is waving their inventions upon waking up from a glorious nap.

In that way, surely,
programmers can be seen as part feline.

But really, naps,
are just an underrated form of art.

You know the kinds of naps I am talking about,
the ones where you are not sure what day it is.

Of if the night time means it is early morning,
of late evening, the day after.

And there is this distinct feeling, that while people are still the same,
you have traveled between the universes, somehow.

Yeah,
those kinds of naps.

Programming, is just a form of dreaming,
but because you can program on your computer what is in your imagination.

It is a very magical form of dreaming,
a whole different kinds of creativity and invention.

Go ahead, why don’t you try it,
all you need, to get started, is search for [JavaScript Tutorial][1]
