Dancing Yourself To Health; Or, Just Dance, And Don't Stop Under Any Circumstance
Thursday • March 30th 2023 • 8:50:57 pm

As a rule of thumb,
do the exercises that kind of feel dumb.

Nobody knows why this works,
but it comes with all the perks.

You will transform quickly,
and stop feeloing sickly.

And few will interrupt your workout,
as you will dazzle them with doubt.

---

Dancing is the best,
and you will never feel stressed.

You’re just flexing around,
keeping yourself off the ground.

Moving your whole body is key,
you have to set all your limbs free.

I recommend [Cutting Shapes And Shuffle Dancing][1],
as it helps with endurance and advancing.

---

But dance with dumbbells,
that send a powerful message to your fat cells.

Never try to jump into dancing right away,
at first you have to learn to sway.

Then discover your favorite moves,
and keep going until your speed improves.

You may need an interval timer,
it is like a workout designer.

And frequently test,
how close you are to eliminating rest.

A fast uninterrupted hour long workout,
is what it is all about.

The faster you move,
the more you improve.

Find good songs and hit every beat,
and you’ll become an athlete.

---

Finally, speed up your dance,
and get yourself into a trance.

Once your songs become too slow,
speed them up to protect your flow.

Audacity and ffmpeg can alter tempo,
and no audible distortion will show.

---

It takes as long as it takes,
but try not to take breaks.

I rest my legs on weekends,
but it depends.

I workout and hour every day,
Monday through Friday.

Though I won’t feel weak,
once I switch to 7 days per week.

You’ll know when you can advance,
just let your body get used to fast dance.

---

It is all about slowly increasing endurance,
so give your body a chance and just dance.
