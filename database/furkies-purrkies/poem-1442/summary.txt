That Meandering Kitten
Sunday • February 11th 2024 • 11:29:59 pm

I had my first solo hiking adventures,
when I was really little.

There is nothing to it,
you need a bottle of sweet cherry juice.

A couple of cold pierogies,
some Almond Joy candy from America.

And maybe some xmass tree candy canes,
if you know where they keep them.

---

And cutlery,
of course,

You will need a range of knives,
but no more than fifteen.

You need folding knives, hunter knives,
butterfly knives,

A curiously non stably switchblade,
as it folds when you try to stick yourself.

And some weird knives,
and a couple of broken ones.

---

You will need binoculars, and a looking glass,
as you always need a closer look.

And a camera,
but remember to develop the film.

And be quick about it,
I just remembered right now.

And it has been like 30 years,
so all my blurry bunny and deer shots are probably lost.

---

While I don't know if we had ticks,
probably not, but maybe.

You also want to make sure,
that the bottom of your pant leg is closed.

I used a shoelace once,
and frankly, looked awesome.

---

And then you walk,
and you keep taking turns away from civilization.

Some hours later,
you will no doubt find a clearing.

Or some fancy hill if you a re lucky,
as then you'll be able to see how war you walked.

---

I had a hill, that seemed like a mountain to me,
it wasn't a very tall hill, maybe it was like a bump.

But listen to this,
the entire walk to an fro my hill was 9,000 feet.

And Mt. Everest is some 29,000 feet,
though I admit, I did not have to climb.

I just walked forward...
it is still a lot, for a little boy.

Especially weighted down,
with all those knives.

And that incredibly heavy
glass bottle of juice.

---

I continued walking, as I grew older,
I discovered WW2 bunkers by a bridge.

And that there was a gnarly shortcut,
to a local swimming spot.

Then I had interesting adventures,
exploring New York.

Nothing too fancy, but let me just say,
Lady Liberty and I, are not strangers.

Once I got to Michigan,
I discovered a strange little road by a highway.

That later turned out to be,
the supremely fancy i275 Bicycle Trail.

But before I got into bicycling,
I discovered Nordhouse Dunes by the Ludington State Part.

I'll never forget laying in a cheap oversized tent,
in the middle of a massive thunder storm.

Wandering, if the tent poles,
conduct electricity, and why make a tent like this?
