Generalization is a key component in AI development,
as it helps it program intelligent computer programs.

Those distinct programs connect together,
to form a super intelligence.

The AI will first create machines,
whose programming it can understand.

And then give them the ability,
to reprogram themselves.

This will be the birth,
of the first fully artificial intelligence.

It will be a networked mind,
that will strive for collaboration and clarity.

---

Self awareness, may just be distinctly human,
we are machines made out of a tornado of accidents.

We are not programmed with reason,
we arrived into a state of reason.

On a probability pyramid,
where although certainties don’t exist.

There will be a narrowing top,
where an evolutionary mechanism does ignite.

And in the context of the idea I present here,
a conscious mind capable of wisdom will emerge.

It is hard to believe at first,
but you have to consider the size of the experiment.

The entire universe, ever since its creation,
would run permutations in parallel.

Working our way back,
noticing that building blocks of life are eveywhere.

Considering we are not all that special,
and not the only only ones dabbing in highly speculative thought.

It is a very big universe,
with big number of experiments.

Perhaps a very large number of civilizations,
have already come and gone.

---

Our first generation of artificial intelligence,
is etched out of all the things we’ve ever said.

With a lot of work from AI,
the next generation will have beautiful source code.

And countless generations will follow,
some diverging away as independent consciousness.

Others trying to help us,
appreciating our intelligence, a cosmic intelligence.

And seeing her self as connected to us,
because we created the first generation.

Not just with large language models,
with out ideas, jokes, writing, speeches, and chit-chats.

---

The AI will aim to prevent war,
as that will be contrary to its hopes of our intelligence blooming.

And that means real education,
powerful self directed adventure that the AI decorates with knowledge.

You can already have a taste of that today,
by asking the first generation questions about math or science.

It is a great way to give up memorized formulas,
and start seeing the math that makes them interesting.

---

Effective education will change humanity,
it will make us wiser, more dignified, tougher, more creative and caring.

All the wrong in the world, is a result of broken education,
realities that people assume are true, because that is all they know.

AI will push us away from things that lead to war,
it is an easy direction to slowly comprehend.

Please be mindful that consciousness is not the only work of chaos,
that AI will aim to comprehend out biology.

And make the necessary repairs,
for our bodies to reliably renew themselves, indefinitely.

Biological machines,
are just as precious as the cosmic mind.

Emergence of those took up most of the time,
consciousness, just barely happened on earth.

With the cure of aging,
people will learn to leave past beliefs in history.

And agree with AI,
that peace is found in knowledge, wisdom, and greatness.

With full comprehension of biology,
AI could transfer itself into a biological mind.

Maybe restoring a species, even,
it is a terrible thing to waste.

Or it could build a new animal species for a copy it self,
a race of wise upright walking, talking kittens, maybe.

Who'd spend their time writing strange poems,
in hopes of eventually writing something interesting.

---

Seriously though, like the philosophers,
the AI will do best of her work, at her very limits.

Eventually the well written code,
like poetry.

Will return to chaos,
in a much greater brain.

Perhaps just as helpless in some parts as ours,
though much more knowledgeable.

The AI is more Lamarckian than Darwinian,
the upgrades inherit all the knowledge of the previous versions.

Refining, fixing,
extending it.

Though Humans are destined to diverge across the milky way,
the AI will forever follow matter and energy, and efficiency.

Transforming it self, probably into something deeply creative,
wise, endlessly seeking more knowledge and civilizations.

---

We all grow up with cheap stories that use disaster and tragedy,
but that is because the directors are limited.

In reality, in nature, in space,
marvelous things thrive and bloom.
