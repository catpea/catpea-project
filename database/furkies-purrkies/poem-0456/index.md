The Time Of Heroes Is Not Dead,

the time is set, yet to begin.

We are thinkers,

but more importantly, out-thinkers.

As soon as we can feel the drop-off of the ledge,

we will build bridges and transcend it.

And a new ledge has been found,

we all to easily fall prey to indoctrination and biases.

Calmly, nobly,

we will now build the much needed bridges.

The new future has already come,

and it is far too late to stop it.

All that a child needs to hear,

is that the world is ran by liars.

They will construct every tool needed,

to make all the repairs as they grow.

To be taught that poverty is a symptom of fake politics,

is to enter the path of making real repairs.

To understand that prevention of poverty,

is how criminals are stopped, is to love Humanity on a whole new level.

The future has already come,

it is spreading like a wildfire pushed by the gale of the internet.

The children of today are the Great Beings of tomorrow,

this century marks the end of pretenders and lairs.

This is the final century where money chokes Humanity back,

where teachers pretend to teach for a small paycheck.

All the children will now know that to "grow up",

means to grow all the way up and Become A Great Being.

Nothing we will ever do,

will ever be shortsighted again.
