Bodybuilding done right is very easy,
and it never hurts.

Nor are you in any danger,
of getting hurt.

Because bodybuilding demands,
that you start in the beginning.

And advance gradually,
so that your body has time to adapt.

---

This is what our bodies are for,
this is how they work.

---

And bodybuilding,
does not start at the gym.

Nor is it about the weights,
duration is more important.

So it starts as slowly jogging,
with the lightest of dumbbells.

And first and foremost,
is the elimination of rest.

So it is just like jogging,
except you carry light dumbbells.

And not so light that you can carry more,
but not so heavy that you must stop.

Bodybuilding is wonderful,
and it transforms you in months.

You just keep adding,
a little bit more weight.

In 2 or 2.5 lb increments,
don’t go up by 5lb as that is too much.

---

Learn to lift to beats of songs,
to enter a dance trance.

Don’t just listen to them,
move to them.

One beat up,
next beat down.

---

By the time you are jogging with 7.5lb,
non-stop for an hour, you see huge results.

You will need a gym,
as it is gets harder to jog outside.

Especially when you get to 17.5lb,
for two or three hours.

Where you need to lift,
the dumbbells above your head as well.

You will probably fall,
if you try to jog like that.

But by the time you cross 15lb per hand,
you are an athlete.

You become obscenely powerful,
anything beyond that is monster territory.

If you just go up by a little bit,
and give your body time to adapt.

It just continues growing,
you get very big.

---

Finally, please understand,
that people who lift heavy.

Don’t lift for long enough,
for their bodies to begin adapting.

They will grow some muscle,
especially initially.

But basically,
they are cut off.

They can’t go up higher in weight,
they can’t work out longer.

They have crushed themselves,
into a corner.

---

Remember, non stop duration,
must come first.

Then on top of that,
you lift gradually heavier.

And use beats of songs,
to enter a dance trance.

---

The reward of bodybuilding,
is not just looks.

To put it simply,
you become young again.
