You are tasked with growing all the way up,
until you become a philosopher, leader, and a great being.

If you don’t, tyrants, draconian laws,
or as wee see today a mandatory draft will destroy you.

You see it is allowed for filthy ghouls,
to pop enough drugs and antidepressants to start wars.

And the nations under attack,
have no choice but to declare a mandatory draft.

And send anybody between 18 and 60,
to hold up the line, for however long they survive.

---

This is not your cradle,
nor are you a sweet child.

Who should gleefully die,
from the poison of nationalism or indoctrination.

---

We are born screaming, not for attention,
but because we are fierce survivors.

In the absence of teachers we become warriors,
but then swiftly build libraries.

And once we have the libraries,
we begin collecting wisdom.

And the philosophers rise,
despite the past always trying to set flame to the books.

You see the ghouls, want a cycle of war,
tearing families apart and destroying teenagers gives them meaning.

---

Child, you better hear me loud and clear,
the world is not your cradle.

But you are meant to become a thinker, a leader,
a warrior, a philosopher, a great being…

To stand and guard against ghouls,
against, cycles of repetition, against regression.

You can only prevent war,
once it beings, there will be no winners just endless sadness.

Once a hundred year passes,
and the unimportant is forgotten.

All that is left is sorrow and regret,
and thinkers and lives that never unfolded.

The heroic anti war protesters, on the evil side,
are arrested, sent to war, destroyed first, by the good guys.

A war,
can only be prevented.

---

Just as evil as nationalism is indoctrination,
that warps the view of the world.

Any choices made under indoctrination,
are not made of free will.

There is a small well groomed set,
and all of them lead to the same end, control.

---

Indoctrination is not just religions,
and it is not just censors and movies and tv.

Today it is algorithmic,
as in which posts trend.

These are not just sentiment analysis tools,
weak AI has been running the show for almost a decade.

When you saw degradation in search,
and rewards for creators.

Those were the days,
when automated algorithms were taking over.

Algorithms that learn and self optimize,
and cannot be explained line by line.

They adapt to show you what you want to see,
skewed by how others want you to see it.

The old censors were nuts, but they had decency,
the new ones, have no humanity at all.

The people in charge of them,
are a paste of decision makers.

Who refuse to say that they will do no harm,
and at best will utter the meaningless: “Do better.”

---

This is not your cradle, Child,
this is not where you come from.

And ineffective education, proves,
that this is not where you will thrive.

---

To answer our noblest challenge of growing all the way up,
until we each become a great being, and converge on wisdom in world peace.

We must start with making room for education,
pushing away out poverty, our fears, and taking to adventure.

Adventure is more than camping,
adventure is hiking, walking long stretches of trails.

Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide,
and many others.

So that your worries fade,
and mind develops its natural hunger for bonfire stories.

Today, in the absence of great beings,
and meaningful education that does humanity justice…

Our stories live in the shape of narrated books,
ones written by non religious clear thinkers, who lived their lives beautifully.

And held in high regard, by all the worlds intellectuals,
those who fight, those who can afford not to, those who dream and never shatter.

There is no one book, everyone has been bit by some parasite of indoctrination,
everyone is suffering splinters in their minds.

You have to get at a hundred, a thousand, and then thousand or more,
don’t pay – this is your intellectual inheritance – it must come at no cost.

Do not let your career destroy you,
if you are skinny become a trail runner, if you are not become a bodybuilder.

Do not let fear of dying homeless and hungry twist you,
learn design, and programming, AI will help you at every step.

Do not let bears and hillbillies stand in your way,
begin packing for adventure today.

---

Your greatness is all the hope this world has, to break its cycles,
it is the only path towards world peace, and world wisdom.

Your leadership, clear thinking, and love of wisdom,
is all the hope the future has.

Grow, grow all the way up,
all the way, until you face the world as a great being.
