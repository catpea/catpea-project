Each time someone loses belief in themselves,

the world becomes a darker place.

---

The bad people are sick and broken,

they only have as much power as you give them.

The more you grow in strength,

the weaker, they become.

Humans are unbreakable, just as soon as new borders are defined,

we absorb all the hardships, and enlarge our hearts and minds.

The more we are wronged, the more powerful we become,

the closer to all the other beings who fought for good.

The bad people are only broken children, they can't grow,

they do not know that a Human, can only rise, when hurt.

---

Humans are born warriors,

our minds were forged in battle.

We are also philosophers,

each of our hardships, becomes a breathtaking page in our memoir.

No ache, ever goes wasted,

it becomes sacred and inspired wisdom to help others rise.

---

The only way for Humanity to grow,

is for each and every Human to become a Great Being.

Your struggles are a call to Heroism,

become a teacher, and help Humanity learn.

Greatness, is the new adulthood,

Greatness, is Humanity's Health.
