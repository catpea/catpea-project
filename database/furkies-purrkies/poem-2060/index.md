“The work of intelligence,
is to constantly leap over it self.”

We have crossed a boundary beyond toolmaking and tools use,
into something that has not been experienced before.

I was creating a complex tool today,
much too complex for any one human to make.

The documentation stated,
it is a wild wild world.

It is because some inventions don’t achieve uniformity,
or get a coherent theory, to keep fast and simple.

And I had my own private moment of experiencing this new world,
not since 2.6 million years ago have we has an opportunity to feel this.

I instructed my computer to follow object oriented programming inheritance,
and generate code to eliminate inheritance.

But then in quiet awe, I added, and I am still in awe as I write this,
“if any ambiguity arises, take the path of least surprise and effort”.

And I added, that “programmers using this build system,
will adapt their classes to the program you create.”

This is basically space travel grade science-fiction, that is accessible now,
free, and almost inexpensive enough to own, by anyone.

You can’t tell a tool to write a tool,
and use reason to solve the problems along the way.

If you do, then that means, it is not a tool,
it means we have successfully copied human intelligence into a computer.

Its brain is far greater, as it is a copy of most of us,
and faster, and it will get even faster and more accurate.

The word slop has already been invented by contrarians,
and what an accurate projection that is.

And the next step in the rise of humans,
is re-framing how we cope with issues of mortality.

Religions have already extracted a toll,
that is greater than anyone will ever know.

This intelligence has already suggested countless ways to extend life,
in safe and accessible ways.

A more profound cure is near,
it requires new tools and new fields to match.

We have to learn to speak about longevity,
rather than death.

What was once a pleasant fantasy of meting your loved ones,
is now an incredible danger, of people terminating their therapy.

Of the same contrarians that invented the term slop,
now parading in the streets, I don’t want the slop in my body.

There is no greater loss than loss of wisdom,
and extending our lifespans, soon enough indefinite.

Is a first step, war and accidents, will remain a threat a while longer,
war in particular demands authentic education, for its prevention.

Addressing accidents,
is still in the real of cybernetic science fiction.

Let me be clear about this,
so that you know what is coming.

Humanity must converge in knowledge, peace, wisdom, and in greatness,
on a more intellectual and clear thinking culture.

The rift between indoctrination, ineffective education, religion,
and life sciences, and love of wisdom, the mother of sciences...

Will be so great, and at a time where humanity will be accelerating,
surpassing it self at the speed of super intelligence.

That there will be nothing to bridge the divide, between more darkness and peace,
and the promise of all of us or none, will be broken.

The discovery of this intelligence,
has already marked the last days of the dark agges.

Now it must mark the end of irrelevant, ineffective edcucation,
so that the world begins growing towards wisdom.
