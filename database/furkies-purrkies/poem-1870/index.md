Nordhouse dunes is a tiny wilderness,
by a cute end of the road town named Ludington, in Western Michigan.

But any wilderness will do, so as long as your car is miles away,
and you live in a tent in an area that will cheer you up.

---

You should pack in the evening, and hope to drive in the morning,
to beat all traffic, but not have to worry about hitting a deer.

Before you leave home, empty your house of kitchen appliances,
your crusty toaster, trusty smokeless grill, microwave.

If you are done with overeating, just give them away,
and if you can't, cut the plugs off.

You will always regret it, but this will serve as a marker,
that reminds you how important escaping obesity is.

You will not return to the stores to shop for another toaster,
you are about to become an adventurer, you don’t need toast.

Eventually, you’ll see all the things that made overeating easy,
as dangerous and quite unnecessary.

Getting rid of your kitchen appliances,
wont seem so shocking then.

This is after all,
about your health.

---

When you are not adventuring, and while still large,
your diet is just bits meat on a bed of shredded lettuce.

You can use any dressing and trimmings,
so as long as most of your meal is just delicious crispy lettuce.

---

Unless you don’t’ eat sugar anymore, all adventures should begin,
with a tiny little bit of ice cream, if you can find it.

Ludington has two huge supermarkets serving a large area,
you can get hiking gear, extra water, and sausages.

You can only get food for a day or two before it spoils in the sun,
so you are not completely cut-off from civilization.

You visit a well stocked country gas station,
or just drive all the way out to the supermarkets.

You earn your sausage,
by needing to walk for miles to get to your car.

And if you head for the city,
by checking out small town antique stores and local pawn shops.

---

Every moment you are in the litter city, you lose weight,
you teach your body to use energy, and aim to eat healthy.

There is nothing to be found at a fast food restaurant now,
because you need to hurry back, to gather wood for your fire.

Where you will roast your sausage on a stick,
and not really feel like eating any carbs.

Roasted sausages and even hot dogs are delicious in the woods,
your calorie consumption drops like crazy.

And unlike a diet at home, you don’t slow down,
you keep going out on interesting adventures.

Slowly, spending more and more time at the wilderness,
and getting used to walking a few miles to the car…

So you can get your sausage for the evening,
and extra stuff you never tried before.

A hot peeper thing, that you instantly regret,
but love with all your heart, non the less.

Because when was the last time you danced around a fire,
breathlessly yelping, hot, hot, hot, hot.

---

Wilderness evenings are amazing, you start by gathering wood,
late in the afternoon.

And prepare your fire, and then you go out to the main attraction,
at Nordhouse, that is Lake Michigan.

Because you out on the western end of Michigan,
every evening comes with a beautiful sunset.

---

You never really return, you stop by home, to get some gear,
and you head on out to the next adventure.

Eventually, you won't need a wilderness,
as you will enjoy passing through State Parks and such.

The only real rule there is, is visiting every antique store,
and perhaps spreading shells on a beach to make the tourists happy.

---

You keep on trucking until all the walking transforms your body,
so that you can slowly power walk with dumbells.

For hours non stop, not so light that you can lift more,
but never so heavy, that you must stop.

---

If you do go out to Nordhouse and meet an Ancient Raccoon,
his name is Friday, he is the King of The Wilderness

He will watch over you,
and make sure that you never feel lonesome.
