This text is about encouraging young people to learn programming,
turning the time wasted on hoop jumping in High School into something precious.

---

Once a programmer,
always a programmer.

Just moment ago,
I tested a new operator that I called [fromBetweenEvents][0]

It allowed me to create a [pressingActivity][1],
which is a lot more friendlier than listening for events.

It is a lot more conceptually inviting,
and what you would expect from programming a mouse.

There is no end to such inventions,
you slowly build a library of useful blocks you snap together.

If it helps people get stuff done they will pay for it,
but you can do better than internet.

Because you are working with graphics,
you pretty much build in the realm of computer games.

And you can release a [Handheld Visual Programming Environment][2],
on an android handheld, meant for gaming.

You can easily have your CodeBoy moment here,
and that is just your start.

Artificial intelligence,
will only get better.

Very soon programmers will realize,
that visual programming is everything.

Because it lets them do the programming,
while AI does the coding.

And before you know it building tools,
and not browsing web will have its moment.

---

This is all about learning programming,
Signals and Handhelds are just a stepping stone.

These are the diagrams you draw in High School,
and small and beautiful triumphs you have making your first sales.

---

The big question is, where do you go,
after you master Signals, Reactive Programming.

And have your fill of Visual Programming,
across those years you will discover repeating curiosities.

And moving towards what calls to you,
is likely where you will have your greatest discoveries.

Where you will create your best inventions,
because what calls to youâ€¦

Predisposes you to take those precious extra steps,
that few others will have the curiosity for.

A programmer is an inventor, not an operator,
you are always building your own way.

Always inventing,
and always growing.
