La Liberté Éclairant Le Monde: From Generation To Generation, or Recognizing Indoctrination
Sunday • October 3rd 2021 • 11:10:39 am

(La Liberté Éclairant Le Monde is French for Liberty Enlightening the World)

It is unclear if parents understand the way children do,\
it may not be the blight of indoctrination alone that holds us back.

It maybe that children are so much smarter,\
and parents so burdened with poverty and confusion, that **everything** is lost in translation.

Parents know schools are broken, they know their grades were fake,\
and yet, in their slumber, they send their children towards the same things.

The children eventually let go of their intelligence, brilliance, and genius,\
because they can see it interferes with grades, and may even cause [dread (TRIGGER WARNING)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vHzUTtmbAM).

---

Every child is a genius, even if that wasn't true - which it is,\
there are infinite ways to get at science or music composition, and leadership, or entrepreneurship.

---

We are extremely adaptive,\
we are not rocks thrown into water.

But, if we are taught that reality is something other than it really is,\
then the sacred space in which we do our decision making is - violated, and we become hijacked, and it becomes unstable.

I always had trouble understanding how someone can cause harm, or commit a crime,\
and I came to conclude that a criminal pulls the trigger for the same reason that soldiers around the world do.

Their view of reality is often permanently warped,\
and they are under some pressure, and influence.

It could be influence of alcohol or worse,\
but also it can be the influence of being court marshaled or even yelled at by someone in control of their existence.

I immediately realized that criminals are indoctrinated into crime,\
this religion of crime, is not exactly emergent, it does not exactly come out of nowhere.

It comes out of poverty, from having parents who drink or do drugs because they can't make their way out of their poverty,\
and then the threat of the neighborhood bullies, which often, as far as survival goes, means both gangs and the police.

All those scary individuals that most people agree to keep in cages,\
are actually just children who had their minds poisoned.

I wouldn't say that it is a permanent poisoning,\
I feel that psychologists know this.

And they a...

...eans that at birth a child is given enough money,\
to afford effective tutors that truly teach Knowledge and Wisdom, enough money to own a home, dream about family, and never fear hunger.

Do. you. not. understand that when you threaten children with military or poverty or some dumb ass idea of hell,\
they give up their genius - how do you not see that?

---

Fake education where teachers feed on paychecks like vampires,\
just to push children to schools that charge even more once they are old enough to work.

How can sustaining ineffective education until something is done to fix it,\
be presented as a justification for propagation of fake schooling.

---

The tolerance of Recruiting soldiers with action-movie like commercials and the promise of free education,\
among the groups of kids who have not lived long enough to coalesce their knowledge into wisdom is another form of indoctrination.

Military recruitment to oil machinery of war with minds and bodies,\
is what real schools and cultures of wisdom were supposed to help us rise from.

A military that takes no interest in helping the world rise out of dark ages,\
is a military that is not interested in peace.

Wars cannot be won by waging more wars,\
not can nations be pacified with propaganda, indoctrination, and fantasies.

Only wisdom can bring World Peace,\
only education that truly works, equality that is actually meaningful in context of entire lives.

---

Know that Narrated Books about real lives and real wisdom of beings who made a positive and lasting impact on the modern world,\
are a good source of wisdom.

Use the Library, try not to let people make money from the misfortune of fake education,\
but hurry find your way to thousands of meaningful books, as that is the education that has been denied to us all.

\--

Learn to recognize Indoctrination,\
use the idea of indoctrination as a tool to understand broken and often unfixable things.

Know, that preventing of fracturing is the noblest way,\
our civilization must embrace prevention as the most humane way to end mistakes.

And above all, break out of whatever invisible walls maybe surrounding you,\
use it as a key, to set yourself and the world free.

You are meant to become,\
a Great Being.
