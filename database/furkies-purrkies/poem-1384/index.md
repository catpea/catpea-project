Well, somehow a situation arises, likely due to broken schools,
where people manipulate meanings and significance of words.

The results pull humanity back, they undo progress,
and for a moment, trouble makes reemerge from pages of history.

The idea of the Gentle Lady and Gentleman, is a good example,
as it is not currently being undermined, being seen as old fashion.

We want to be in the right place, so that we are not seen as outdated,
but that is the trick of it, that is how we are manipulated.

Gentle, means ennobled, a gentle person,
is a person who has been ennobled by their deeds.

But you don’t have to know this,
to know that a gentle person is a virtue, that it is something meaningful.

The officer, is the military version of the gentleman,
and never stood a chance, ever – that has now been completely obscured.

The motive behind destruction of living above the common level of life,
is simple superiority, simple and easy tings.

It is the triumph of the bully defeated by his father,
who can now call himself superior, by merely wallowing in his own sh%t.

Chan you imagine what it must feel like, going from being seen as a disaster,
to an alfa, supreme, who rose without any effort or virtue.

Precisely because the virtue has been destroyed,
brought down, to the level of zero.

Philosophy, among other things, is the story of out growing up,
it reminds us why each of the ever higher virtues and aims exist.

While it is possible to demonize a concept out of a culture,
the consequences will lead us back to reinventing the same solutions.

The story of Philosophy, or love of wisdom,
exists to spare humanity repetition of mistakes.

That needles loop that could have been avoided had we knew more,
humanity will not advance without bringing its best ideas along.

And philosophy, is where we store our best ideas,
and the highest of our heights.

All it takes to take them out of storage,
and inherit them as our own wisdom.

Is an adventure,
like walking the Continental Divide, Pacific Crest, or Appalachian Trails.

And all the narrated adventure and non-fiction books,
that are loves by thinkers and adventurers, philosophers and clear thinking intellectuals.

Whatever has been taken from your culture, can be easily restored,
by listening to the triumphs of people who started where you now stand.
