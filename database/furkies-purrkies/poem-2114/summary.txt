The Paranoid Middle Ages, In Which Everyone Is Plotting Against Everyone Else
Saturday • December 13th 2025 • 8:10:02 pm

If there is one thing we can say with confidence about medieval Europeans, it is that they were absolutely certain someone was out to get them. And not just any someone—an elaborately organized, diabolically clever, probably supernatural someone, working through networks so vast and secret that their very invisibility was proof of how powerful they must be.

In this respect, at least, we haven't changed much.

But medieval conspiracy theories had a quality that modern ones often lack: they were remarkably creative. Where we tend to blame shadowy government agencies or tech billionaires—rather unimaginative targets, really—the medieval mind could conjure networks involving demons, foreign sorcerers, poisoned spices, shape-shifting werewolves, and the occasional immortal monk. If you're going to be paranoid, you might as well be theatrical about it.

## The Devil's Grand Alliance

To understand the medieval conspiracy mindset, you have to appreciate that for most people in, say, the fourteenth century, the Devil was not a metaphor. He was as real as the king, considerably more powerful, and much better organized. While earthly rulers squabbled over patches of territory and couldn't manage to collect taxes without starting a rebellion, Satan apparently ran a continent-spanning operation with the efficiency of a modern logistics company.

According to authorities like Johannes Nider, a fifteenth-century Dominican friar who really ought to have found better uses for his time, witches, heretics, and Jews were all working together in a single coordinated alliance with Satan himself. Their goal? Nothing less than the destruction of all Christian monarchies. How exactly a scattered collection of elderly village healers, theological dissenters, and marginalized religious minorities were supposed to accomplish this was never entirely clear, but that was rather the point. The conspiracy's very implausibility was evidence of dark supernatural backing.

The Cathars of southern France were particular targets of this thinking. Here was a group of Christians who believed, rather inconveniently for the Church, that the material world was the creation of an evil deity. They practiced vegetarianism, rejected the sacraments, and though...

...down wisdom from the pre-Christian past.

There is, as it happens, some truth mixed into this fantasy. Medieval stonemasons did use geometric systems that were kept within the craft, and some imagery in churches does draw on older traditions. But the conspiracy theory version transformed technical knowledge and artistic creativity into a continent-spanning secret society manipulating Christian worship from within.

## Why We Believe

It would be comforting to think that medieval people believed these things because they were ignorant—that education and scientific understanding have made us immune to such errors. But this isn't quite right.

Medieval conspiracy theories served the same psychological functions as modern ones. They explained misfortune in a world that often seemed arbitrary and cruel. They identified enemies when the real causes of suffering—disease, economic forces, the weather—were impersonal and therefore unsatisfying. They created community by defining who was inside and who was outside, who could be trusted and who must be watched.

And they were often encouraged by authorities who found them useful. Witch trials consolidated Church power. Anti-Jewish conspiracy theories distracted populations from genuine grievances against their rulers. Rumors of foreign poisoners justified wars and persecutions that served political ends.

The conspiracy theory, in other words, was not simply a mistake. It was a tool—one that could be wielded by the powerful against the powerless, but also by ordinary people trying to make sense of a bewildering world. The specific beliefs have changed, but the underlying patterns remain remarkably consistent.

We no longer worry about the Devil coordinating heretics and Jews in a continental alliance against Christianity. But we have our own versions: shadowy elites manipulating elections, corporations suppressing miracle cures, networks of evildoers embedded in institutions we should be able to trust. The faces change; the structure persists.

Perhaps the most valuable thing about studying medieval conspiracy theories is not the window they provide into the past, but the mirror they hold up to the present. The medieval mind, it turns out, looks rather uncomfortably familiar.
