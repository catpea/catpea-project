Merry Squirrels
Saturday • December 24th 2022 • 7:52:02 pm

Last Christmas I gave the squirrels __bags__ of peanuts,
and they just quickly squirreled them away in their tree huts.

A lot of them got buried in the ground,
though I think those were quickly found.

---

This year I almost fed them by hand,
until it all metaphysically came out of their other end.

Now they just sit in their tree,
and want nothing to do with me.

---

But, we've traveled far together, for sure, yup,
from my startup idea of selling them as kittens in a cup.

To them chewing into my enormous box of emergency pandemic trail mix,
and probably replacing all the nuts with their ticks.

So, I just want them to have a Merry Christmas you know,
I don't want therm to be digging around in the snow.

---

They left a single peanut on a fire a hydrant for me,
though, I can't tell if it is a threat or a plea.

Maybe they __are__ just being lazy, I am not sure,
I suppose, they don't need me anymore.

The wobbly drunken one that lives in the crab-able tree,
seems to down right hate me.

---

Now I know what you are going to say,
try as you may;

There is neither inspiration nor wisdom to be found,
in a poem about Squirrels burring peanuts in the ground.

But I beg to differ, if I may,
for squirrels teach and remind us every day,

Of the importance of dance and play,
and enjoyment of every holiday.
