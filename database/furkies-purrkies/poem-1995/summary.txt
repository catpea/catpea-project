And This Is Where You Start...

**And on the Eighth Day**

The old monk traced the patterns of war
through centuries of scrolls and tears—
each conflict born from seeds before:
minds shaped by another's fears.

"And on the eighth day," he wrote with care,
"let no soul bend another's thought,
no child be molded unaware,
no truth be sold or bought.

For we are not clay for kings to form,
nor empty vessels for their dreams.
Each mind deserves its native storm,
its own rivers, its own streams.

Humanity walks toward wisdom's gate
not through the maze of fantasy's design,
but through the questions we create
when thought remains truly mine.

Let every culture's voice ring clear,
untainted by the puppeteer's string.
When minds can think without fear,
then peace becomes a living thing.

We are unfinished, ever-growing,
each generation's work undone—
but only through clear seeing, knowing,
can many voices become one."

The monk set down his weathered pen,
gazed out at valleys far below:
"First, free the mind—and only then
can seeds of lasting peace truly grow."

**Bens's Last Testament**

The old philosopher sat by candlelight,
his fingers trembling on the quill—
"I blocked a clause that would have made it right,
and now I see the blood it spills.

I thought the Book of Ruth contained our way:
'Your people shall be mine,' she said.
But fantasy breeds killing fields, I say—
wisdom converges, dogma spreads the dead.

In Philadelphia's hall, I held my tongue
when Adams spoke of minds held free.
I worried that our nation, being young,
needed stories more than liberty.

But now I've seen the pattern clear as glass:
each war begins with captured thought,
each tyrant first must hold the mind's compass
before the body can be bought.

The Constitution missed its greatest line—
that no authority shall bend
the sacred architecture of the mind,
nor make belief a means to any end.

From Canton's ports to Afrika's gold shore,
from Iroquois to Sanskrit sage,
all beings who've seen through fantasy's door
converge upon wisdom's common page.

The Cherokee knew what Athens taught,
the Mandarin what Moses learned:
that truth cannot be given, only sought,
and minds enslaved make nations burned.

If I could stand once more upon that floor,
I'd carve in stone what I now know:
'No doctrine shall con...

...ng lies. To them I say: we are no longer children. It is time to put away childish things.

The enforcement legislation will be comprehensive. The manipulation of consciousness through deliberately false information will be treated as assault. The systematic distortion of reality for profit will be prosecuted as fraud. The indoctrination of children will be recognized as child abuse. These are not restrictions on free speech—they are protections of free thought.

To our international partners and adversaries alike: we can no longer accept diplomatic relations predicated on mutual deception. We can no longer engage in trade that depends on manipulated desire. We can no longer participate in a global order built on the premise that human beings cannot handle truth.

This is not naïveté. This is necessity. Every war in human history began with a lie believed. Every atrocity started with a mind deliberately warped. We have split the atom, mapped the genome, and touched the stars, yet we still permit the kind of mental manipulation that our ancestors would recognize from ten thousand years ago. This paradox ends today.

The poet wrote that the truth shall set you free. We have learned, through centuries of blood and sorrow, that its absence makes us slaves.

To those who question whether humanity can survive such truth, I answer: we cannot survive without it. We stand at the threshold of challenges that will require our clearest sight—climate change, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, space colonization. We cannot navigate these dangers with minds clouded by manipulation.

The 28th Amendment is not merely law. It is a declaration that humanity is ready to grow up. That we are prepared to face reality without filters, to make decisions without deception, to build our future on the solid ground of truth rather than the shifting sands of manipulation.

This is our gift to the future: minds free to think, eyes free to see, consciousness free to expand without the distortions that have shaped human misery for too long.

The amendment takes effect immediately. The age of cognitive sovereignty begins now.

May we prove worthy of the clarity we have finally chosen to protect.

May Humanity help us bear the truth we have committed to honor...
