AI Can Help You Build And Sell Tiny Web Applicaions
Wednesday • November 19th 2025 • 7:16:42 pm

AI is really good at programming,
this basically eliminates poverty, but it certainly makes you stop fearing it.

---

I told ai to stich the pixel-slicer now known as [nine-slice][2],
with the [panner-zoomer][1] we created earlier.

And I went to lay down,
just to drive the point home.

After a few moments, I pulled up the live-demo running on a local server,
and there it was, perfect!

And very useful,
I can perfectly zoom into the pixels I am slicing.

---

From a technical stand point,
AI is able to make useful applications out of generic libraries it creates.

So as long as you think big,
the code will flow and run clean.

---

Even a bigger deal than this,
is user profile, or member login.

Which would be a much much simpler container,
than a pan and zoom system.

And the only thing beyond that,
is member sign-up and pay.

As with everything else we must stay away from complexity,
so the payment gateway would be the keeper of credit cards.

That leaves us with username and password, so a third party login,
as in login with account of your choice.

Because this is a monthly billing tool,
we don’t need to keep track of items bought.

Just ask the billing server,
if a billing-monthy account with a specific email is active.

So we can almost eliminate the need for server,
but we certainly eliminate the need for storing sensitive data anywhere on the server.

The server is only used for making sure the user logs in,
and passing information through that login, to the billing system.

----

AI is good at very pretty pixel art,
you build a slicer to make buttons and panes.

You wrap your slicer in a generic pan and zoom,
so that it becomes a precision tool.

You then wrap that in membership required,
with a monthly billing system.

You then wrap this into a Website Theme generator,
not builder, but AI based generator, cheap and powerful.

And once the users take their themes and sell at their market places of choice,
you wrap the whole in your own marketplace.

Tell them they get a deal for exclusive license,
where a theme is only sold in your store.

And extra bonuses for social media posts,
which is just linking to their products.

But you show a list of other users products,
creating a cross-advertising system.

---

Artificial Intelligence is now good enough,
to create everything for you.

If you are worried about security of your software,
you just ask your AI to write a security analysis.

But when writing lightweight low code liability software,
as I showed here, AI wont introduce security bugs.

Those only end up in convoluted programs,
where there are multiple borders that AIs just don’t understand.

---

I think middle-school is where programming with AI must begin,
and by High School, it must become a full time adventure.

AI delivers, by next year, the miracles we see today will seem small,
so this path of side businesses, will only become easier.

Just to give you a sense of urgency,
I think this has become possible as of last month.

AI just keeps growing, [fusing my slicer with a pan zoom container][3] it made,
while I lay in bed furiously refreshing the page to see if it is done.

Is unlike anything, that has ever occurred,
such power of COMPETENT automatic intelligence has never existed before.

And I just want to underline, that if I had 4 human programmers do this,
we would still be fixing bugs in 2027.

Don’t even wait for middle-school,
get the AI to write web applications without delay.

Parents, get your stuff together, AI does not need internet,
you can [install it locally][3], get them a nice desktop and get out of their way.

Do it now,
don’t delay.
