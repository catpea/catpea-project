In the heart of a bodybuilding Valhalla,
surrounded by adults struggling to count to 10.

And taking all to long to rest,
to pass any fitness test.

There mingle young ladies,
who lift in a different mode.

Young ladies,
who cracked the bodybuilding code.

Many a man of former glory,
with arms that tell a long story.

Now overshadowed by the swift and unstoppable,
the previously improbable.

Teenage ninja bodybuilder girl,
outpacing the typical, in mid snarl.

And their formula is simple,
start with a jog for one hour.

When you build up endurance,
to run straight through your race.

You add light dumbbells,
one per each hand.

Though no so light that you can lift more,
and not so heavy that yo will be forced to stop.

And you fight, one or two hours a day,
until the dumbbell weights give way.

And you move on up to the next weight,
all the while becoming greater than great.

When these Amazon Valkyries get to the heavy,
the jogging stops, and the pace drops.

But the exercise continues non stop,
thousands of lifts per hour.

Awaiting the next time the body adapts,
to go to even heavier weight perhaps.

The older adults wander “what is wrong with you?”,
the boys run scared, as they always do.

The trainer is at a loss,
to explain the cause.

But the girls are just kicking through,
with fine disregard for rule.

Surrounded, surrounded,
by mere mortal men, struggling to merely count to 10.

But they rise to no end,
starting a bodybuilding trend.
