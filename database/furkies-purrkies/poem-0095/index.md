It is a pretty dark trick,

and it makes life run out all too quick.

If all were to be tricked to break the link,

that they can't climb on giants to think;

And all became mere muscle and bone,

humanity would fade in vain, with a deathly moan.

---

We have to remind each other, so that we don't forget,

or we will fade, without feeling a hint of regret.

You are meant to become a Great Being,

you are finely crafted for the Art of Seeing.

With your unstoppable sight,

as your greatest might...

You can understand anything,

and rise higher than any king,

it is your right!

---

You are meant to rise, at least to the status of a Hero,

keep people from running themselves into a zero.

That power is in each and every one of us,

and we must be Noble and Wise,

so that no one can stop us.

Know with certainty that it is always Spring Season,

to stand up for Truth & Reason.

Know that Truth and Beauty is always right,

and yours, is that Power and Might.
