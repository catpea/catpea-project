Well, now you begin your authentic education,
by having AI help you write a book, based on books you listen to.

And then narrating it, for remembering things,
but also for your family, for sharing with strangers, and adventure.

Basically you become as curious and unrestrained as Thales,
as knowledge seeking as Hypatia, and as trouble making as Socrates.

That is where it all ended, kind of before things begun,
so that is where you begin.

---

You have been betrayed by your teachers and guardians,
on multiple levels, so you can’t trust them with knowledge.

Which is great,
because that was always a pretty sus idea.

Imagine telling your sweet,
what to think, and what to believe in.

That is not just disrespectful,
but actually extremely bad, if not cruel.

So your teachers and guardians,
needed to show you how to learn.

And help you get started,
with all the world’s most clear thinking intelectuals.

Many of them made mistakes,
but that is where their wisdom and books comes from.

Rising out,
of those mistakes.

Precisely for the purpose of showing you what not to do,
to in some part, make their suffering count for more.

Unlike fantasy books, real books, show you why and how,
and the resulting culture of the risen, that you inherit.

You don’t have to read and re-read to memorize,
you just get to know the author, and you will understand the why and how.

Just like you understand why your friends get in trouble,
and how they rise above them.

It makes sense to you without memorization,
because real stories are human.

Fake ones are of composite creatures,
layered incompatible ideas that would make a real person ill.

---

Of course, you can’t just sit down to an AI,
and tell it to write a book, as no one would read it.

What you are actually creating, is memory keepsakes,
they are about your questions at the age you are at.

So maybe who was Hypatia, Thales, Heraclitus, Socrates,
Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Spinoza, Kant.

Nietzsche, Viktor Frankl, Ayn Rand, Christopher Hitchens,
Daniel Dennett, Sir Ken Robinson, and many others.

One or two with these would mark a chapter,
that you would fill with AI generated biographies, and AI letters from them.

You’d have to read books about them first,
to be sure that the AI is correct, that is of course research and learning.

And then you put everything into a well structured book,
and narrate it.

Like education, graduation is obviously not a piece of paper,
so you walk the [Triple Crown][1].

The Appalachian Trail, The Pacific Crest Trail,
and the Dontinental Divide Trail, listening to more books.

Which as you continue learning will eventually help you to rise,
towards becoming an sovereign, intransigent great being.
