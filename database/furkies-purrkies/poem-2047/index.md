I suspect, we are just a few months away, again,
from the whole world becoming almost new.

Very few people are able to predict it, basically nobody knows,
even the old Wizards themselves are adventuring elsewhere.

As with most things these days,
this is arising now due to AI.

The specifics are live conversations with a smart AI,
where you can speak naturally and AI answers with feeling.

And the key it self, is the final function key on your keyboard,
F12.

---

You hit F12, and ask your AI,
what the doodle am I looking at.

What language is it,
what is this pane, what is that pane.

Why is CSS so weird,
“You apply properties to selected HTML elements”

What the heck is HTML,
“it is a cute way to represent nested objects.”

Right about here, your next 30 years will start,
the marvels, the genius, the puzzles, the joy, will be epic, legendary.

---

During your first conversation,
you should ask, “Where the hell is the editor”.

And when AI tells you to install something,
you have to say no.

We are going to make a code editor in a [dev tools panel][0],
and publish it as a [Web Extension][1].

Lets use [Code Mirror][2],
perhaps [wrapped in a WebComponent][3] for convenience.

Because I want my editor,
my way.

---

Your code editor is you, it is your original vision of code,
following this vision will extend your mind.

Maybe it is lots of little editor panes that are minimized to stickers,
icons generated with an AI.

Creating a wall of such enchanting complexity,
that internet people will pay you to watch you code.

Maybe, it will be 3d,
it is after all litle more than clever x, y and scaling.

Maybe it will be pixel art,
maybe you’ll create a code editor with pixel fornts.

It is very easy, you just make 25 rows, 80 letters wide,
and tell your reader to render text at line x.

Don’t worry about wrapping,
worry about pixel cats and squirels.

Or you can render a vast cyberspace of code,
efficient and fast, that demands a powerful RTX video card.

---

Maybe, you’ll switch to games,
maybe music generation.

Maybe AI agent development,
maybe create an operating system called F11.

Hopefully pixel-art,
where people will come to your website, hit F11 to for full screen.

And enter your operating system,
your cyberspace.

And then they can marvel,
about all the wonders they discover.

How every little creature tiding up your cyberspace,
is powered by powerful AI, constantly improving your platform.
