No Human is meant to rule,
but neither should anyone grow up uneducated and/or poor.

Understand why all creatures,
beautifully share the same features.

Know who and what you are,
that you are born of a star.

---

Neither war nor poverty, nor fake school,
will ever become a useful tool.

And your intelligence is not to spread like slime mold,
it must rise, and leap, and replace the old.

Because, if all we do is follow,
then the future becomes, hollow.

It is better to be a black sheep ember,
then to witness Humanity in its own December.

You are meant to rise and think,
and you are, a precious chain link.


---

Stress, and fear, unravels our minds,
it is a blight, that blinds.

But you are an artist, and creator, and a genius too,
there is nothing that you can’t grow to do.

Please, you must neither serve nor fear,
because your life is far too dear.

---

There are no teachers to go around,
and poverty has our hands tightly bound.

But you __have to__ center yourself,
and make your way to your first bookshelf.

To see the world the way it really looks,
it will take you 10,000 wise books.

---

In the absence of teachers,
and overabundance of false preachers…

__You__ are charged with becoming a great being,
and helping others become just as wise and farseeing.
