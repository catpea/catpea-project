Make Each Day Count
Monday • April 6th 2020 • 7:25:25 pm

Captain's Log: Quarantine.

Day Twenty One.

There is birdsong outside, and I can feel the sun.

I woke up rested, for the first time, in years.

My mind was hardly ever tired, but all the rest needed time.

I am ready for gyms to reopen, It will be so much fun.

I will dance even faster, workout longer.

My diet is twice as good as it was before,

including soup, and proper portion control.

It took twenty one days,

for my body to begin recovering from my workouts.

What a great sadness it would be, to wish now,

that I should have danced, or tried harder.

Instead, here I am. Bouncy, and perky as heck,

Ready to go back.

Use your days wisely,

let no day slip away.

Live, make each day count,

it all adds together, balance your account.

What makes us great,

is the sum of all the days in the past.

What makes us strong,

is making each day better than the one before.

Make each day count,

enlarge your world.
