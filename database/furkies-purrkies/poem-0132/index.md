I always try hard to learn something new,

so that my elder self can mumble "I grew."

I try to listen to a non-fiction book or two,

to update my general world view.

---

And I do computer programming and research too,

I have lots of bookmarks in my queue.

I am trying to write programs as if I had a crew,

so I stick to simple systems where I can think things through.

---

Learning Life, and Programming somehow fits me like a shoe,

I'll have to make a list of the books and papers I read through.

I never have to try to look for something new,

there are too many beautiful things to get bored, or blue.

---

I like learning about things that are most Human and true,

trying to figure our what our elder selves wished they knew.

Someday, I would like to write a book to help young people get a better world view,

something short and beautiful that they can quickly finish, slam shut, and say "Who knew?"
