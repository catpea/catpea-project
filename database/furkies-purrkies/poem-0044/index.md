Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Nine,

A vegetable juice out of line.

The Tomato with Sprinkles was born of accident,

when making my salad, this is how it went;

The salad bag tore,

and some of the salad went on the floor.

But a fistful, fell in my tomato juice,

and decorated it with sprinkles of produce.

It is hard to recommend, but I must say,

it tasted great, and I'll drink it everyday.
