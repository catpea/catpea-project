Rising Up
Friday • July 25th 2025 • 8:48:58 pm

When you are in your classroom, at your desk,
and watch a useless lecture, feel an unfair grade.

Or seemingly discover, all on your own, the incredible advantage,
of memorization and cramming.

You should center yourself,
and consider that, something. is wrong.

---

Because schools are for the love of your mind,
for the safety and future of all human kind.

They are not meant to be fake,
or ineffective.

They are not meant to be,
irrelevant to who you are.

---

Not a single day in school,
should ever be gray.

Or ever make you feel,
like a tool.

---

You can’t tolerate fake education,
it is not allowed.

Because if you do,
you will destroy the world.

The world is built on wisdom,
vast layer by layer.

And when people give that up,
they fall.

Digging a hole,
is all they do.

All the way down,
to zero.

---

You cannot side-load,
things that cant fit.

And if you try hard enough,
you will destroy yourself.

---

But you can build up,
higher, and you darn well should.

Creating something,
that we can all admire.

We are connected in rising together,
not drawing new borders to speak with different tongues.

We are in it together,
as one people, in one direction, up.

Growing up, all the way up,
until we each stand as great being.

And lend our shoulders,
to those who are yet to come.
