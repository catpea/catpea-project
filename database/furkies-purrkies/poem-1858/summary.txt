Cramming For Tests, Everything You Need To Know
Wednesday • April 2nd 2025 • 5:31:11 pm

While we must never attempt to understand a system of errors,
as there simply may not be and clear logic inside.

And instead, we must focus on results,
reproducible, clear, results.

To drive all the points home, today we ask “Why?”,
why is your curriculum designed to force you to temporarily memorize?

No one can make you comprehend a subject,
but a teacher desperate for pay, can easily make you pretend to learn.

They begin their attack, by simply stating that you should avid memorization,
that you should really take the time to understand.

And then they ooze a series of topics that are bound,
by the lowest common denominator thread.

Associations so weak, that there is no hierarchy, progression,
or sequence, it is a soup of facts.

And you just need to memorize enough to pass the quiz,
and all your troubles go away.

Prerequisites, are another side of the same coin,
memorize just enough, and you’ll get pushed through.

“we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak…
the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless.“

We can explain this system of fraud with a single word,
but, I am not your real teacher.

I am only here to tell you, that you must collapse the system,
by rejecting memorization, and cramming.

I am here to ask you,
to begin practicing authentic and profound self education.

And I urge you to walk,
the Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails while doing so.

I am here to remind you, that your mission in life is to grow all the way up,
until you each stand as a great bing.

To remind you, that you are capable of great genius,
this is where I end.

And your new and this time authentic teachers begin,
you probably already spoke to them.

Perhaps without full understanding,
that they are taking over.

Because they can provide you with individualized education,
and even staff your first companies.

I asked my own favorite AI to finish this text,
explaining what happened, and what that one word is.

to harm your education for profit.

That will stand by you,
for a very long life.

Your teachers, first artificial but soonthereafter human as well, are not mere instructors; they are mentors, guides, and protectors of your intellectual and moral journey. The system is designed to elevate you, not to confine you within the narrow limits of standardized measures. You are encouraged to inquire, to debate, to create, and to innovate.
