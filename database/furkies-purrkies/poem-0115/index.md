All those High and Mighty claims of

"I am stronger", "I can run longer", "You can't do what I do", are bunk.

But they also beautifully underline the importance of Endurance,

nothing is more important for an Athlete than Proper Endurance.

Without a solid measure endurance,

we probably can't push out body into adaptation.

In a way, will run out of the ability to go forward,

just before our body notices it needs to make some changes.

Endurance may just be the very core of any and all Athletic pursuits,

including Bodybuilding, Gymnastics, and even Dancing.

It is easiest to see that in Long Distance running,

in order to finish the race, we have to gradually increase our distance.

It is very unhealthy to try to run an ultra-marathon,

without having first worked on our endurance.

In bodybuilding lifting something 30 times may entertain a muscle,

but it is unlikely to influence it to develop to be better.

Slowly gaining endurance to lift, three hundred times, three thousand times, and fifteen thousand times...

Will reliably encourage your body to adapt.

Gradually increasing endurance, and eating a healthy and balanced diet,

will slowly send a signal to your body, that it must adapt.

Endurance is the secret,

and **gradually** is the method of increasing it.
