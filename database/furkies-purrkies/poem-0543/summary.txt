Reject Fake Education And Become A Real Teacher
Wednesday • August 25th 2021 • 8:48:49 pm

There is only one kind of education,\
and that is Integrated Education.

And that means,\
that everything you learn is strongly connected.

There are no grades here, you get paid for achievement,\
and you graduate the moment you build your first successful company.

---

The way you learn Math for example,\
is by starting out with computer programming.

In the world of programming all the math is done for you,\
until you are ready to create something generated by a computer.

This could be a series of generative artworks,\
or even generative products that can be sold online.

Eventually, you will either get stuck,\
or become seriously interested in real math, to accomplish something - that you need.

And what will come next is not learning math,\
but it's complete self driven mastery, because you will need it.

From here you may take to CNC milling machines, 3D printers,\
water or laser cutters.

---

An integrated education, is a single road,\
and each new stretch of the road emerges from the entire distance that you have traveled thus far.

It is an education that is important to you,\
that is absolutely your own achievement.

You learn at your own pace,\
and you learn in a sequence that you set.

A sequence that fits your existing knowledge,\
and where you stand, and is respectful of where you are headed next.

---

You will not be graded,\
you will not have a grade point average.

But there will be investors interested in good ideas,\
and minds that are deeply passionate about them.

Investors are people that give you free money,\
thousands of dollars with a promise of more, if you show good ideas and good progress.

In the end, they may own 10% of your company,\
and certainly will be interested in its success, as much as you are.

They will only make money when you make money,\
they are there to help you, so that they can help themselves.

Most of them will be graduates of the schools you joined,\
they are there to mentor you, they are there to help you grow.

---

This second part of this text tries to explain.\
how and why you are being tricked.

But you should consider this part as being mostly wrong,\
and use your own best judgment to figure out what is actually going on in your own school.

Above all stop pretending that...

...ors will give you money,\
for connecting them with the graduates.

---

Fake education will end,\
just as soon as people will begin noticing real results from real schools.

Parents who were once prepared to put some money towards college,\
will much rather spend that money on classes that provide real results.

---

Finally, I will leave you with an example of such a little school,\
lets us assume that you are curious about 3D printing...

Though this applies to any stepping stone like dance, music, photo realistic drawing,\
any stepping stone that helps people out of poverty.

So you begin learning FreeCAD, and Blender,\
and get an Ender printer.

As you learn you create a curriculum, with lovely milestones,\
for others to follow.

While being mindful, that they will require a powerful and authentic entry in their portfolio;\
perhaps one that includes videos, sketches, and maybe a real newspaper article about graduating from your class.

And then you take in some number of students,\
and begin teaching them how to get to a point where they are able to print things that are useful to them.

You get them to buy an Ender,\
you help them assemble and fine tune it, and teach them how to set up and use all the software.

They will want to get to the end,\
they will want to print things, build things.

You can expand your school,\
to teach related subjects - and your students and graduates will help to advertise it.

Unlike the fake schools,\
your graduates with walk out with the ability to create real products.

---

From a more general perspective,\
people will be learning what they need,

They will be progressing on their own path of real self education,\
one that brings results.

---

Please,\
please...

Stop pretending that you are actually learning in school, stop memorizing disconnected facts,\
start learning for your self, in a sequence that makes sense to you.

Help the other students understand,\
set them free to a bright future they can understand.

And help the lost kids in the back understand that the school they know now put them there because it is all just a show to sell them out,\
tell them that they too were geniuses all along, and that their genius and creativity will know no bounds once they take to self education.
