Captain's Log: Day Nineteen of Quarantine.

Tomorrow, day twenty may have rhyme a plenty,

but it won't rhyme with quarantine, and that was unforeseen.

I waited all day to write,

to see if something interesting may bite.

I wanted to draw and paint, and dance and prance,

but ended up discovering a new [poem about taking chance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4).

I ended up programming, music and art,

I aimed to do something relaxing, but smart.

Such are meow days, and had been forever and more,

searching for all things special and all the things I adore.

Now, I am finishing today's poem, one foot already in bed,

Though I already had my salad, I wonder if I should make some bread.

That's sounds about right,

I'll waddle downstairs and grab a bite.

Goodnight.
