Choking some part of your body with heavy weights,
is not fitness, or bodybuilding.

It cuts off your circulation and whatever else,
and it cuts you off from finishing your exercise.

Furthermore, muscle group isolation and posture,
limits how many muscles you challenge.

Your excessive is supposed to last a long time and involve a lot of muscles.
so that your body receives the signal for adaptation.

And you are supposed to flex, turn, twist, and yes, dance,
so that you engage your entire body not just four muscles at a time.

---

Telling people to stand still,
while they perform muscle isolation exercises.

But for no more than 45 seconds,
and only three times a week.

Sounds like an attack, a conspiracy,
against fitness.

---

You are supposed to perform your exercise for an hour,
with weights that don’t force you to stop.

And continue that exercise, until your body adapts to lift more,
at which point you start mixing in heavier weights.

Until you don’t need to use your old weights anymore,
and you are fully switched to a higher weight.

That adaptation, that new strength,
is where larger muscles come from.

Your body only grows new muscle to handle new weight,
as you continue stimulating, and challenging it.

---

Choking of muscles with weights that are much too heavy,
turns what should be a 60 minute exercise, into a 60 seconds exercise.

Heavy weights prevent you from stimulating your muscles for long enough,
what can choking your arms of legs possibly tell your body?

How do I know,
it needs to be longer than 60 seconds?

By looking at the legs of a fat man,
by looking at the legs of a jogger.

And what would those legs look like,
had they only exercised them 60 seconds in 3 sets of 10 reps.

---

It is also a terrible idea, to work on one area of your body,
there is not enough time in the day, to cover multiple areas.

You are going to have to perform a full body exercise,
because you really have no choice.

There is no configuration other than a full body exercise that will make you fit,
fitness requires a symphony orchestra of muscles.

When you are unintentionally dancing on a slippery stretch of ice,
it is not just 6 or 8 muscles that you need, but all of them.

---

Choking and Isolating, For Seconds all together,
are a disaster, that prevents fitness.

Whoever started this myth, must have done so the same way you propagate it,
unintentionally, just by doing what everyone else was doing.

---

“What’s it to me?”, exactly that, you are spreading a myth,
that ends any and all hope of transformation.

When daily walks with groceries, builds more muscle,
than bodybuilding at the gym, it is time to rethink what you are going.

---

I now give you exercises that are more powerful,
than what I just described.

If you are large,
walking for two or three hours every day.

If you can, bicycle, pedal fast,
for two hours every day.

It is a great start,
to make your way towards the next step,

Hiking, for weeks at a time, away from stress,
explosive legs and abdominal, you never sit and you eat meat like a beast.

And then you come to the gym, string all standing dumbbell exercises together,
and begin dancing a little, to the beats in your slower songs.

One beat lift your weight up,
the next beat, let them down.

And let the motion synchronized to music,
help you enter a dance trance where time moves faster and faster.

Lift light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and never ever so heavy that you are choked and forced to stop.

When you can et through your workout without being challenged,
that means, your body has adapted, your muscles grew.

And you must start lifting heavier by no more than 2.5 pounds,
to the slowest of your songs, so that you get a bit more time at first.

Or workout to slightly faster music, and/or stay a little longer,
to burn more fat, and transform faster.

But remember your first workout must be light weights,
so that you can get through the hour.

And if the light weights are impossible to lift for a long time,
do what joggers do, don’t call it a workout, until you eliminate all rest.

---

No more sets and reps, no more muscle isolation,
no more choking yourself out of a workout – let us burry this worthless myth.

Start walking with dumbbells, or jogging with wrist weights,
get ready to dance with dumbbells at the gym.

It is only aerobics at first, once you start lifting heavier and heavier non-stop,
it transforms into fitness and bodybuilding.

And remember, if you have to stop, you are doing it wrong;
it is not how heavy you lift, but how long you lift your heavy for.
