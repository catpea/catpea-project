You are as intelligent as everyone else,
people who seem smarter are not genetically better.

Most people genuinely good at specific subjects,
just enjoy them, think about them in free time.

A lot of people just memorize,
and teachers greatly benefit from that.

Because that means,
they don’t have to do anything.

The memorizes run on autopilot,
just to get to then next semester.

But then upon graduation,
they don’t actually know anything.

They know the f-word, and the s-word,
they want an impersonal world.

An uninspired world,
whey they don’t have to try.

---

This is what bullies want,
to shame, to spread darkness.

For the whole world to be as dark,
as their own world.

This way, they can just suffer,
and never have to know the pain of rising.

---

You have to reject fake education,
or it will make you crazy.

Failing school ends hope of career,
but jumping hoops breaks you in.

You can’t go through life,
wishing to watch the world to burn.

---

Anytime you are challenged,
[is an opportunity to become a hero][1].

It is hard to get off the ground the first time,
but it teaches you to rise, better the next time.

And [without, becoming a bully yourself][2],
in wisdom, and in a dignity.

Rand once wrote “If a drought strikes them, animals perish—man builds irrigation canals; if a flood strikes them, animals perish—man builds dams; if a carnivorous pack attacks them, animals perish—man writes the Constitution of the United States.”

If schools force you to memorize,
and pretend to learn, or even teach useless things.

You don’t stay down and participate in that,
you rise and demand an authentic education.

Life without real knowledge,
slowly becomes depressing servitude.

If no one’s there to teach you,
then you use Narrated Books and AI.

Get an overview of how adults think,
by listening to [Short History Of Nearly Everything][3]

And [pay attention to your situation][4],
don’t just try to get through high school or college.

At the very least, High School needs to teach you programming,
and using a wall projector for photorealistic painting, or beat sequencer for music.

Programming at that age, more than anything,
teaches you what real learning looks like.

So that when you encounter a teacher that lies,
or tries to waste a semester of Philosophy on the life and times of Descartes.

You walk out, and not return,
until you have someone to inspire you to love wisdom, Philo Sophia.

Without the experience of a real subject,
teachers will just throw things that are hard to untangle.

And trick you into thinking that that challenge,
means that it is something valuable.

[Meanwhile they will just make up grades][5],
and convince you, that you are an A, B, C, or a total loser.

---

Explain to the principal that you need teachers that will teach you programming,
or the whole school will walk out.

And their little fake education scheme,
will become everyone problem.

Tell you parents, you are being cheated out of authentic education,
that you want to graduate high school being able to program AI Agents.

So that you can automate workflows,
maybe build some small side projects.

Once you can program things, programming languages,
can help you understand how math, physics, chemistry works later on.

---

If you are not learning for real,
the school is just stealing knowledge from you.

---

And beyond school, you have to keep learning and growing,
until you become a great being.

In context of life, authentic comprehension is very precious,
as you learn to understand other theories by subtle analogies.

You have to stop memorizing for tests,
and start talking about real, meaningful, a functional education.

That will keep you out of poverty,
and enable you to build your own future.
