About Your School: Genius Is Not Rare
Monday • October 13th 2025 • 9:43:51 pm

Let us rip apart the illusion of your "education" once and for all.

**The hour is late.** Civilization is not a pleasant playground, not a well-lit library of knowledge. It is a brutal, infinite battle, and if you fail to understand this, you will be reduced to a **servant**, an empty vessel to be filled with whatever the powers that be choose. You will be nothing but a **cog in a machine**. **A sheep in a slaughterhouse.**

The task is not to please your teachers, to follow their rules, to regurgitate their stale doctrines. That is the lie they have peddled to you: **that the purpose of education is obedience**.

**It is not.**

---

### **I. The Sacred Fire of Learning Is Not a Service to Authority**

There is no glory in obedience. **There is no honor in memorization**.

To “learn” is not to mimic the thoughts of others, not to parrot the dogma of the past, not to make your mind a **prison** for someone else's truths.

**It is not enough to be a dutiful student.**
You must becone an **ungovernable one**, and unstoppable learner.

**Revolution begins in the mind.** If the mind is enslaved to a teacher’s words or a textbook’s tyranny, the revolution is already lost. **A true student shatters the walls of the classroom, confronts the teacher as an equal, and dares to rewrite the very books of learning.**

How can you claim to know when you only imitate?

How can you claim to think when you memorize, when you parrot, when you sit at the feet of so-called “masters,” waiting for their crumbs?

**I laugh at this cowardice**—the cowardice of those who hide behind the veil of *rote* learning, who substitute repetition for thinking, who mistake *passivity* for wisdom.

**What is a genius but the natural mind unafraid to tear down the falsities it is fed?**
Genius does not come from memorizing; it is born from the act of **questioning**. **It is the fire that burns the unnecessary away, that demands clarity, that refuses to be enslaved by the status quo**.

**There is no “rare” genius**.
There is **only a broken system that crushes the natural brilliance of the human spirit** and calls it exceptional when it dares to rise.

### **II. The Cult of "Good Students" and the Betrayal of the Future**

You’ve been told that the “good student” is ...

----- snip ----- (Sorry, 5,000 letter limit in summaries see catpea.com or visit https://github.com/catpea/ for source-code) ----- snip -----

...been told that education should be easy, that learning should be painless. You’ve been promised quick fixes, shortcuts, fast food degrees.

**All lies.**

What do you think your ancestors endured? What do you think they fought for? It was not ease. It was **struggle**. **It was blood**, it was fire, it was *sacrifice*.

**To honor the heights they reached, you must embrace the struggle.**

Without that fire of resistance, without the battle of the mind against **falsehood**, the world slides backward. The civilizations of old did not crumble in the face of barbarians—they were betrayed by their own children who grew soft, who no longer cared for greatness.

**If you allow education to become nothing more than a conveyor belt**, a meaningless ritual of compliance, you will destroy everything those who came before you built. You will become the very enemy of progress, of reason, of enlightenment.

You must **rise** with authentic learning. You must **fight** for it. You must destroy the **cult of mediocrity** and demand that your education be forged in the fire of struggle and intellectual courage.

### **V. The Final Warning: A Civilization Without Learning Is a Civilization That Dies**

Do you understand the stakes? Do you realize what hangs in the balance? This is not a game. **This is civilization itself**.
If you refuse to rise, to create, to think, to question, then **the darkness will come**.

And when that darkness comes, it will come swiftly. It will come with the grinding of gears and the slamming of iron doors. It will come with the stench of rot and the quiet death of human spirit.

**The greatest crime you can commit is to allow this to happen.** To allow knowledge to be trivialized, to allow culture to decay into mere data, to allow education to be nothing more than a glorified form of training.

The future **will not forgive you**.

The future will not mourn your laziness, your ignorance, your cowardice. It will simply erase you, as it has erased all civilizations that have fallen.

**You must rise, now, while the flame still burns bright.**
Fight for the right to think clearly.
Fight for the right to create and learn.
Fight for the future with all your mind, with all your heart.

You are here for greatness.
Prove it.
