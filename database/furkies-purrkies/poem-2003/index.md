Build open and lightweight and sell commercial licenses, only,
they allow commercial use of your applications and assets.

You may make it difficult to access your application code,
but it is good advertising to give it  away for non-commercial use.

This means, you have no security nothing that can be stolen,
nothing is under lock and key.

If someone deletes their downloads b mistake,
they just download it from your website without logging in.

---

You credit card processor,
does not need special configuration.

The customer pays,
and you just send them text with the damn license.

By setting the license upwards of $16 dollars, maybe at $64,
no one will care to test stolen cards with it.

You have nothing to hack, nothing to monitor,
no enter your username to re-download.

Or enter your email,
we’ll re-send your password guacamole.

Just over two years ago, this would be a wise,
but super tiny start,

Today generative AI make you so overwhelmingly powerful,
that you can go up against outfits with multiple hundreds of nose-picking employees.

---

I can’t tell you what to sell, but the broad answer is,
the things that you find lovely.

If you like UFO’s sell perfectly authentic UFO art,
if you like GUI’s, ask AI for graphic rich web components.

For example, today, the web only has [border-image][1],
it is 1990s technology, in damn near 2030, the great age of AI.

---

Commercially licensing advanced graphic components,
with AI generated decorations, is wonderful.

No one yet knows, how important a pretty user interface is,
because all the college taught kids optimize to look like every other bland UI.

But design should come first, and application second,
you want a tree growing around your to-do, as an indicator of being late.

You want crystal and water based, glass spheres,
as progress indicators.

And buttons, that are candy,
and fruits, all the fruits.

---

The user interfaces of today are awful,
everything is boring and bloated.

A window should never be square,
and no shape should ever be geometric.

---

I want you to imagine a button,
that is purely based on one of 36 AI generated fruits.

Based on a 6x6 sprite-sheet,
that also includes variations featuring shadows, glows and candies.

You have hundreds of such 6x6 sprite-sheets,
free to use for noncommercial purposes.

And only $64,
for a commercial license.

And that is just,
a button.

Imagine what you can do,
with all the other user interface components.

Fantasy user interfaces, including UFO dashboards,
and strange exoplanet walpapers.

Your customers just click buy license, the processor takes a couple of percent.
And they get an email with the text license, and download away.

---

While you work on your next business,
perhaps beautiful electron JS applications that use your own pretty user interfaces.
