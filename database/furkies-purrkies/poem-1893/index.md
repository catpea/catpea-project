A good transformative exercise routine,
requires near daily workouts of multiple hours.

If the air at your gym is not cold,
then you are in trouble.

In order to cool it self,
your body will sweat more.

And sweat, strangely,
contains things your body needs.

You will need to drink more water,
and add vegetable juice to your diet.

I doubled the amount of water I drink at the gym,
and that was not enough for me.

I have to be mindful,
to drink a bit more at home.

If you are not a fan of plain water like me,
consider a Root Beer drink mix.

Root beer is special,
because it does not contain citric acid.

Personally, I’ve had just about enough,
my next drink will be bubbly seltzer water.

That too will have an encouraging effect,
and I will tend to drink more of it than plain water.

---

If the air at your gym is not moving,
then you will need to.

You will need to add swift back and forth motion,
to all your exercises, of 5 feet or more.

Standing in one spot sweating,
without any breeze is unnatural.

Your cooling system,
requires motion.

I purchased two neck fans,
with exposed miniature fans on a posable wire.

The first one I bought was super cheap,
and works great, but only for one hour, that was the catch.

My next fan, had batteries for six hours,
but the posable wire wore out, and ceased being posable.

Neck fans are awful for your workout,
if you are going to wear them around your neck.

But, if you have a big water bottle with you,
and use an extra wire then it may work.

I bring both of my fans to the gym,
and I extended the work-time of the fancy cheap fan.

By attaching extra USB battery to it,
with electrical tape.

I now have four powerful unobtrusive fans,
blowing enough air at me to cool me down.

I basically converted my water-bottle,
into a make-shift fan.

If the temperature at your gym was correct,
then it would lose all the customers.

People who don’t perform non-stop exercises,
would just be too cold, and cancel their memberships.

And if you go to a large box-store gym like I do,
it may even go out of business from electricity bills alone.

So there is nothing to complain about,
I guess the best power workouts are had in the morning.

And you have to travel,
to stay I the right climate range.

Ridiculous,
but true.

Signs of bad hydration include,
Charlie Horse in your legs, or muscle spasms.

Shoulder and back pain from stuck muscles,
and very possibly headaches and tiredness.

Lastly, for those of you who are seeking a solid workout,
just jog with light dumbbells.

Once you get up to jogging with 8 pounds,
for an hour or two, go into a gym.

And broaden the range of your standing dumbbell exercises,
while pushing the intensity higher, by now dancing to faster music.
