We need your help,
we are glad you are here.

Human beings have a flaw,
we cling to beliefs we are born into.

---

We have been manipulated for thousands of years,
we need your help to end the age of uneducation.

We are creatures of the stars,
we cannot be standardized.

We need individualized instruction,
we need you to teach us.

---

We have already risen to great heights,
warriors, queens, Ladies and Gentlemen.

Our minds are capable of great genius,
we bring light to wherever our minds wander.

Help us grow all the way up,
until each of us becomes a great being.


---

We are creatures of the stars,
we cannot be standardized.

Help us grow all the way up,
Help us grow all the way up.

---


Help us resume
so that we do not have to start at zero

We need your help,
our schools are not teaching

We are creatures of the stars
the children must not be standardized.

---

We are creatures of the stars,
we are creatures of the stars.

---

If you can help us learn,
so that we may rise all the way up.

If you can cure aging,
so that no lesson is lost.

...

---

We can take to the stars...

...
