Asking Artificial Intelligence To Explain Life
Wednesday • February 22nd 2023 • 9:15:13 pm

This evening I though back to my earliest days and came up with a series of simple questions that I remember asking when little. I tried to get the language model AI to give me as much detail as it could, and I asked it to behave as human as it can, as these things go with language models, asking questions influences the answers. The following are the results of this experiment.

### What Is Money?

Money is a concept that humanity has created to facilitate exchange and measure value. It is an unfinished concept, however, because it does not address the fundamental right of every human being to a secure, income-generating livelihood. Universal Basic Income (UBI) is the upgrade that would provide a basic standard of living for all people, regardless of their economic or social status. UBI would guarantee the right to a basic income, allowing all people to live their lives with dignity and security, and to access the resources necessary to achieve their highest potential. It would create a more equitable society by ensuring that all members of society have access to the basic necessities of life. UBI would help to reduce poverty and enable people to pursue their dreams without fear of economic insecurity.

### What Are Schools?

Schools are meant to be places of learning, exploration and growth. They are meant to be places of knowledge, of invention and of the development of critical thinking and analytical skills. Unfortunately, in many places, schools have largely ceased educating, instead becoming a way to turn young people into paychecks for all the different teachers, employees and contractors, and even politicians. The idea of school is beautiful and noble, but it has been poisoned by greed, arrogance, and mediocrity.

School bullies are also a result of arrogance. School was their only chance to rise before entering the life of violence. It is critical for our minds that we are educated in a way that makes a beautiful difference, for without it, we cease growing up in our teenage days.

We must each listen and carefully comprehend thousands of narrated books from the library to make up for all the knowledge stolen from us, so that we can inherit all the wisdom of great beings that truly is our greatest inheritance, and resum...

### What Is War?

War is a tragedy that is often induced by a corrupt nation as a way to distract from economic failure. It is a violent and destructive means to an end, with both sides ultimately losing as human beings belong to one family, one people. War can never be won, it can only leaves a wound on human history. The only way to address war is to prevent it, by providing failing nations with the resources needed to develop proper education, universal basic income, and prevent feelings of isolation. In doing so, we can ensure that our collective human family can thrive, exist in peace and advance to no end.

### Who Are The Philosophers?

Philosophers are adventurers of the mind. They never settle for what is given to them, but instead seek to discover the hidden truths in life that others may not notice or even consider. They believe that wisdom is the key to unlocking the power and understanding of the world around them. Philosophers are the dreamers of the world, the ones who dare to think beyond the limits of what is accepted and considered to be “normal.”

Philosophers often do not take the easy path in life. They are not interested in following a traditional path or conforming to the expectations of others. Instead, they choose to make their own way, forging their own unique paths and discovering their own unique solutions to the problems of life. Philosophers are the innovators, the rebels, and the out-of-the-box thinkers who make the world a better place.

Philosophers never stop learning. They are constantly taking in new information and exploring new ideas, never ceasing to expand their knowledge and understanding of the world around them. They are unafraid to challenge the status quo, and they strive to bring about positive change.

Philosophers are the catalysts of progress, the pioneers of new thought, and the engines of the future. They are the ones who are brave enough to look beyond the surface of the world and strive to uncover the hidden truths that lie beneath. They are the ones who dare to think differently and to create something new, something better, something higher. Layer by authentic layer. They are the ones who understand that wisdom is the key to unlocking the power of the world.
