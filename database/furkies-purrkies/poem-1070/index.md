A huge thunderstorm was approaching Nordhouse,
where I was camping in a bald spot down by an ancient dune.

---

If I was lightening, and I feel I somewhat, am,
certainly a Thunder Cat…

That beautiful sandy bold spot would be the only place
in all of Nordhouse Dunes, that I’d ever care to hit.

---

And while, I was in no real danger, or so I hope,
this was my first time doing a rather loud parle with nature.

For I would complain,
at every thunder, mostly about the tent poles.

When I was little,
it was explained to me,

Not to be scared of the sound,
as it means that I survived the lightening strike.

So I was really, both filing complaints with laws on nature,
and celebrating them, at every strike.


---

But there I was,
laying down on the ground, no pillow.

Surrounded by four evenly spaced,
metal poles, holding up the tent canopy.

According to the label, the tent was highly flammable,
and I should keep it away from sources of ignition.

Right before I put on my headphones,
I realized what an impossible request that is.

[I put on “We Are All Connected” by Symphony Of Science][1],
and fell asleep to Feynman’s Bongo Drums.

I truly felt being deeply connected to the universe,
being alone deep in the tiny wilderness during a big thunderstorm was quite an experience for me.

---

The most beautiful adventures,
are the ones that are full of beautiful surprises.

---

This was my first parle,
but the second connection to nature.

The first time was spent in silence,
trying to understand how I ended up standing in the fabric of the universe.

I drove down to the ocean, it took days,
and I arrived at the beach after dark.

So I hoped into the warm Ocean water,
I certainly wasn’t going to wait until morning.

And I’ve noticed there were little glowing fishes,
and as I slowly looked towards the dark horizon.

The fishes melted with the reflection of the stars,
under the biggest sky I’ve ever seen.

The fishes the reflections and the dark skies,
seem to have created a single whole that warped around me.

---

On my way back up, I turned on the radio, and Dr. Marin Luther King Jr. said,
“Content Of Character”, which seemed like the most beautiful concept I've ever heard.

Up until then I treasured “There Are No Ordinary Moments”,
from [Peaceful Warrior][2].

And was always fond of "Life moves pretty fast.
If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."

Alas, life only moves fast when you do what you are told,
if you do it your way, you'll quickly become a thousand years old.

This is what adventure is for,
building a library of wisdom, developing a love of wisdom, Philo-Sofia.

I hope I am wrong,
but it may just be impossible to start collecting wisdom without gentle adventure.

If you are young, I beg you, to keep a large backpack by your door,
you don’t have to use it, not right away.

Get a tent that packs small, and a sleeping bag,
rated for cold weather, you may get a second tiny one for warm nights.

Put it together at home,
strangely, the only place where it is away from a source of ignition, lightening.

And test it, and make a list of the things you still need,
maybe find a video of bird song, or ocean waves, close your eyes and listen.

Connect with nature, once you are ready,
make sure to bring plenty of narrated books, to fish out your favorite wisdoms.

Never be ashamed to wear multiple fanny packs at once, it looks really cool,
And get a proper Cowboy Hat, everyone needs a cowboy hat.
