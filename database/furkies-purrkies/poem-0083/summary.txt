Uh Oh

I've been sitting here for half an hour,

trying to conjure up my poetic power.

But nothing seems to be coming out,

I think I am going through a poetic drought.

I guess this happens every once in a while,

so it is not a reason not to smile.

But I thought I was already better than that,

I felt like the world's most poetic cat.

Now I struggle to come up with the next line,

though I promise not to whine.

Maybe, there is way to break through by block,

perhaps I should stop staring at the clock.

Oh yes, this worked, I feel much better meow!

I remembered every word, wow!

Wig, pig, pear, bear, sled, bed, boat, goat,

top, mop, wall, ball, duck, truck, mouse house, and blouse.

And what a story that would rhyme,

had I not ran out of time.
