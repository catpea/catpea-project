Having well rounded little ideas like we all do in the beginning is a great power,
and many people will need them as they learn JavaScript.

Why must objects disappear when you refresh the page,
why can’t you have a virtual file system in a web page.

What about an on-screen keyboard,
that shows only the commands you can run in the page.

How about making it into a wiki,
where any body can customize it.

JavaScript is not just for the internet,
a persistent object that de-serializes it self.

Is amazing for programming Electron Desktop applications,
where security is not as limiting as in a web page.

---

My day begun with the idea of an inter-dimensional internet,
way from another world.

Encyclopedia Galactica, where humanity,
is much less than even a pale blue dot.

---

As AI grows more refined, it requires less computation to run it,
so you can generate Encyclopedia Galactica WikiWiki Pages.

After you click on the link, linking to them,
instead of “This article is a stub, do you want to help editing it”.

Just generate the page, from the perspective, of intergalactic species,
make it into a game, make it into a book.

Or make it into a virtual world, Little large language Modes are brains,
that you can query like a database.

How about a news website, a social network for all the aliens,
you know you want it, to see what they say about us.

This months of August, is special, this is our first month of doubt,
statistically July 2025 was where all the bold predictions for contact sat.

Very slowly, out calculations of a busy Milky Way are being proven wrong,
this after, our Darning UFO were finally put to rest as a curious prank.

Why not build a similator, where you explore time dialation,
and calculate hwo to efficiently Terraform and Seed milky way.

JavaScript is the perfect language for such games,
because all it takes to publish//deply is a web page.

And galactic lonesomeness aside,
it is a perfect time for games as generative AI is good at pixel art.

The whole universe is calling out to you:
Learn JavaScript.

You are a child of the [Laniakea Supercluster][1],
and this year it is calling out to us all.
