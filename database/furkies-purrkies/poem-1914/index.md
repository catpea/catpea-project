I asked AI to create some code for me,
just out of curiosity, if it will work.

It did, among a few other things the AI,
is a programming machine.

It created both a [teleprompter][0] for me,
where I can record audio that is spoken when the alarm is triggered.

And the [alarmclock][1] it self,
that has nap time, and proper wake up time.

Any AI will do, you just have to ask to create a single HTML document,
so that it is easy to open it in your browser.

---

I made many modifications,
but I was testing a range of things.

Including how AI influences digital product creation,
specifically components, that can be used to make small applications.

It is now possible to use AI to create products,
similar to [Bootstrap and Themes][2].

But the components would need to be more integrated,
less scattered.

They would need to be WebComponents with styled with CSS,
and require no frameworks, not even Bootstrap it self.

---

It would have to be done right from the beginning,
and always stay in the realm of text instructions for AI.

This is very strange, and very different from Bootstrap,
which relies on precious developer wisdom.

This is the age we live in,
thinking machines can create quality useful things.

So as long as you correctly guide them,
and not just let them invent everything on their own.

Learning programming is still necessary,
and it is a useful skill, but you will not have to all the programming.

You may have a 100 pages, with 1,000 components,
and that can only be cared for by AI.

---

AI will only improve,
it is improving all the time.

It will program it all for you,
but there is no substitute, for your own vision.

You will still have to dream up the products,
and make sure that the AI is moving in the correct direction.
