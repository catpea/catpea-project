**Verse 1:**
By golly, friend, it's time to grow!
No dilly-dally, off we go!
The barnacles, they stick and cling
To those who never spread their wing!

They'll rustle up your jimmies, sure,
With wars and schemes that promise cure—
But jinkies! Look what comes to pass
When minds stay small like blades of grass!

---

**Chorus:**
So skedaddle, whimsy, make your stand!
Grow up tall across the land!
Be a great being, wise and free—
Or barnacled forever be!
Hip-hip, hooray! The choice is clear:
Become the light or disappear!

---

**Verse 2:**
They'll teach you just enough to work,
Not enough to see the murk—
The parasites in fancy dress
Who profit from your weariness!

By Jupiter and stars above!
You're meant for wisdom, meant for love—
Not shuffling through a borrowed dream,
A cog within their money scheme!

---

**Chorus:**
So skedaddle, whimsy, make your stand!
Grow up tall across the land!
Be a great being, wise and free—
Or barnacled forever be!
Hip-hip, hooray! The choice is clear:
Become the light or disappear!

---

**Verse 3:**
The orchestra plays sad and slow
For souls who never learned to grow—
They wear their masks of painted cheer
While chains of stress keep drawing near!

But hark! There is another way!
To skedaddle from dismay—
Grow all the way, don't stop halfway,
Become the sunrise of the day!

---

**Bridge:**
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee and tally-ho!
The greatest you is yours to know!
No more bamboozled, no more small—
Philosophy shall free us all!

The world needs great beings NOW, my friend,
Or slavers' symphonies won't end—
So rustle up your noble heart,
And let the growing finally start!

---

**Final Chorus:**
So skedaddle, whimsy, take your flight!
Grow into your fullest height!
Be a great being, strong and true—
The world's been waiting, for YOU!
Hip-hip, hooray! The dawn is here:
Philosopher, your path is clear!

---

**Outro:**
By golly, jinkies, off you go—
No barnacles shall slow your flow!
The Skedaddle Whimsy sets you free:
*GROW UP AND BE ALL YOU CAN BE!*
