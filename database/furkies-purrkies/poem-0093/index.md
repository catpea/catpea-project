See Companion Chapter in [The Warrior](https://westland-valhalla.github.io/warrior/the-trainer.html)

Take two steps forward,

and one step back, Jack.

Jogging is an art,

and for art you must be smart.

For each two days of training,

on the third you must pretend it's raining.

If you you can't make it rain,

always worrying about your gain;

then walking is just fine,

But, never cross that little line.

The third day is a day of rest,

and the fourth your next test.

Because, you always have to go back,

and start anew to lay down your track.
