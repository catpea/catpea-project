Step One, slowly jogging with light dumbbells,
for the purpose of extending your endurance for a non-stop hour workout.

Joggers instinctively know that it is not jogging,
unless it is non stop.

They first aim to close all their rest gaps,
they may use an interval timer, or a program like Couch To 5K.

Like jogging, real bodybuilding starts,
when you can run with dumbbells for an hour.

In the future,
you may double or quadruple the duration.

You must always test if you can handle,
slightly heavier dumbbells.

Try jogging outside,
and on a soft surface like a trail.

Step Two, bring your dumbbell power to the gym,
here, you will begin lifting to the side, in-front, above, and do bicep curls.

You must start with the lightest dumbbells,
but not so light, that you can handle heavier dumbbells without stopping.

Because the gym is a boring box, try to find an alternative,
try an outside gym, or maybe a park.

You will need music, and fresh playlists of songs you like,
you must synchronize your motion to the beat to achieve a dance trance.

There is no bodybuilding without dance trance,
and you must start with slow songs, and slowly move onto faster.

These exercises don’t work so well when you are jogging,
but to keep pushing your legs, you may never sit, or rest.

When your biceps get tired, switch to lifting above your head,
or to the side, or a mix thereof, and keep tiring all your muscle groups.

Walk back and forth, generally aiming to mimic 1980’s aerobics,
with an aim towards shuffle dancing, where you move faster than jogging.


---

Step Three, add an extra hour to your workout,
to speed up the transformation.

When you can, increase your dumbbell weight,
but no so much that you will be forced to stop.

Get faster songs, but not so fast,
that they will force you to stop.

Eat trailmix, a mix of peanuts and dried fruit,
but soak it in water to soften it.

Add protein
and vegetable juice to your diet.

Keep moving, don’t stop,
as your body adapts you challenge it some more.

---

Finally, sets and reps are a lie,
an easy fantasy to believe.

A lie made up and repeated,
by people wanting to look busy and sound smart.

The sets and reps people who have big muscles,
are former childhood obesity victims, or former fatties.

They got them muscles not frome sets and reps,
but by growing up with twice or thrice the body weight.

Those who were not fat, may just spend enough time,
doing it wrong, to over the course of decades successfully simulate the above.

They switch machines at every song,
workout six or eight hours, and slowly develop.

There are also tall people,
whose body proportions are naturally larger.

By contrast to a short person their muscles will be bigger,
but proportion wise, eventually the same size.

---

Muscle isolation, or getting your physique from gym contraptions,
is problematic, because we are walking and lifting, and moving machines.

There is a sequence and harmony to a functional musculature,
natural motion and gradual adaptation with ever heavier dumbbells is healthier.

---

Your first two or few weeks will make your body ache,
that is basically because you have never used your body before.

Your body got sick, because it is a flexing and moving animal,
now you are awakening your body, repairing it.

It is not the gym that hurts you, the pain means you were sick,
it is the sedimentary lifestyle that was slowly and comfortably killing you.

---

"How long?... will all this take?", months to show results,
two years until others accus you of cheating.

Three years if you were obese but your muscles will be huge,
and one year, if you already looked nice and eat well.

But if you do it wrong (sets and reps)
it will take around 30 – 50 years.

You will show mediocre-to-good results in months,
but listen to this: ONCE, JUST ONCE.

Sets and reps make you lift too heavy,
so you go from potato, to beeffy, to a plateau.

You can't speed up your music, you can't add another hour,
you are always resting,

And you can't go from 40lb to 45lb, and forget 50lb,
your body won't have a chance to adapt.

It can halcel moving from 15 to 17.5, for an hour,
but not the heavy weights, that you are already lifting for just seconds.

---

But “how long?” is the wrong question to ask,
if you just want to look good then after a few years you’ll give up.

You’ll still be fat in your middle age, telling stories how you used to be fit,
that is deeply unwise.

Again we are animals, biological machines,
not being fit, is wrong, unhealthy, dangerous.

You have to work out every day of your life,
an you need to have mighty muscles throughout your entire life.

It is not that bodybuilders age at a slower rate,
it is that non athletic people are ruining their bodies.

We are wise animals,
not office workers.

And that is also why you just can work on your back and chest, abs and biceps,
isolate muscle groups, and just look like you have muscles.

You have to twist and turn, protect your range of motion,
have a strong back, a reliable musculature, a symphony of muscle.

You have to to stay flexible,
be athletic for a long and bouncy life.

May you make wise choices and life,
and grow all the way up until you become a great being.
