To Michiganders That Don't Always Like The Snow
Tuesday • October 27th 2020 • 11:16:47 pm

If you frown at all the snow,

there is something you should know.

Put on your mittens, and a hat,

and buy a big bottle of suntan lotion right where you're at.

But don't drive back home, just turn south on 275,

and drive.

We're going all the way down,

to take care of your frown.

You'll drive through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,

right till you get to good old Georgia.

Here you stop, and get some sleep.

but wake up early, cause we got a pace to keep.

Drive all the way through Florida to US Highway One,

and be ready to catch some sun.

Get to ,

and park beneath .

Now, squirt some suntan lotion.

and enjoy the Ocean.
