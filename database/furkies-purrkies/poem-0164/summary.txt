On A Wintry Starlit Night 17,000 Years Ago
Tuesday • August 11th 2020 • 7:15:56 pm

A legendary creature,

from a winter 17,000 years ago.

Still speaks of Might,

at the Cave of Lascaux.

It was not a hunt,

but a Magical Sight,

It was a Noble Megaloceros,

on a wintry starlit night.

A Family, and a Traveler,

Had to go out and see,

Some, said the titan was as big as a tree,

others imagined him as big as the Baltic Sea.

And the story never gets old,

after 17,000 years, it is still, being told.
