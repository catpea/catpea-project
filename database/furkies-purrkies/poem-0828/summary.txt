The Little Froggie From Peru

Upon having sculpted my ,
I begun pondering what more can be done with little rebuilt artifacts.

I came across a really sad story from Pompeii,
about being found.

There I noticed all the little bits had holes in them,
to hang them on necklaces and such.

So selling a Sorcerer’s Kit,
is another thing that can be done.

I pondered creating a low polygon version,
which is a geometric wire frame.

But this has to be designed from scratch as such,
reducing geometry of a sculpted piece just distorts it.

For blobby sculptures like the froggie,
.

Using a boolean modifier to subtract some of the bottom,
can make a sculpture it stand flat.

I think my best idea is to split the froggie,
very much like the original.

Which calls for ,
using difference boolean modifier and parting it.

Then giving it thickness with Solidify,
followed by a hinge and a locking mechanism.

This way it can become a little trinket box,
this seems like something that should be done manually.

Geometry nodes, may not be the best choice here,
because of how complex the sculpted mesh usually is.

,
a lot of open space that a human hand can’t create.

It makes a piece look intricate,
and saves on material costs.

I have noticed ,
a golden silky filament could maybe make something, but I am not too sure.

The that the Froggie originates from,
is theorized to have faded away 1300 years ago due to climate change.

I could tell the original artist was studying frogs,
it wasn’t just from memory.

They gave the frog a belly, a strong brow, a nose,
.

Whether it is jewelry, a game piece,
or sold as an STL digital model that others can use in their own pursuits.

Rebuilding a 1500 year old artifact,
was quite an amazing adventure.
