Running on ice,\
just isn't very nice.

I tried it thrice,\
and it was not very wise.

Once I slid so far,\
I felt like an ice skating star.

---

It is best not to roll the dice,\
and avoid running on ice.

Patches of ice on a sidewalk are particularly bad,\
that's what I had.

Just wait for the sun to melt the woe,\
rest, and allow your muscles to grow.

---

Or find the nearest trail-head,\
and go on a little adventure instead.

Dress warmly and bring soup,\
call your friends and go as a troop.

A walk in a snowy park is very nice,\
it is much better than running on ice.

---

It is important to remember,\
that there is such a thing as a hot December.

If it is snow you fear,\
then vacation on the other hemisphere.

Where hot and cold are reversed,\
and it is rainy at worst.

---

Any who, I made you a little rhyme,\
that will prevent trouble in no time.

It is a rule we mustn't break,\
as there is too much at stake:

"Ice is cursed,\
safety first."

---

Be it a woodland or tropical forest,\
adventure at home or as a tourist...

Be safe and have fun,\
and share stories with everyone.

Take plenty of photos and frame them all,\
as no adventure is too small.
