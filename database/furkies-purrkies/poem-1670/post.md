First grab your butt,
and check if you’re a cat.

And if that is the case,
give adventure a chase.

But if you only feel a little bump,
above your rump…

And feel wobbly and frail,
you probably need to make a tail.

Although,
it was 25 million years ago.

We all used to have a tail,
alas, evolution is not without a fail.

We still have the genes though,
so we could get them to grow.

But it maybe better, for now,
not to go full out meow.

And use some furry scraps,
to just make a prosthetic tail, perhaps.

Use a belt and an L shaped doodad,
to get it to stick out and wag.

It is sure to chase your bullies away,
and brighten the most cheerful day.

And a tail will make you smart,
and help you turn line to art.

People who have a tail,
never ever fail.

They are great for police,
as they instantly bring peace.

Good for politicians,
and their political missions.

Great for physicians,
and patient conditions.

And awesome for mom and dad,
as it prevents them from getting mad.

And it is a well known fact,
that with a tail you never get smacked.

And all scientists agree,
a tail is good for you and me.
