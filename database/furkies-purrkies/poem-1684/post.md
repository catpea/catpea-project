Every once in a while,
a jogger will pick up 3 or 5 pound dumbbells.

And run for a few months on a
protein sprinkled wet trail mix diet.

To realize they cracked body building,
all they need to do is walk into a gym.

And start dancing with dumbbells,
dancing being much more stable than jogging.

And allowing lifting dumbbells above the head,
without falling and cracking it open.

And our bodies just happen
to be good enough, to handle a daily dance workout.

---

Now the bodybuilders,
who never considered how muscles are built.

And never seen the jogger build up 5 pounds of endurance,
will think he is taking something.

If that jogger suffered childhood obesity,
those muscles will show as a massive body now.

Now the non stop two or three hour dumbbell workouts,
will isolate back, biceps, shoulders, abdominal and legs.

And this lucky jogger,
will do in a year what takes other ten.

---

And how sad, that a person hoping to be a bodybuilder,
can’t go back to 3 or 5 pounds to earn that endurance.

Precisely the same way joggers do it,
by slowly eliminating rest, and stopping.

---

With 5, 10, 15, and the crazy 20 pounds,
in a former fat and slow joggers hands.

There is no plateau here,
to get stuck in.

---

So you see, you received advice,
to lift 10 or 30 times, something you can handle.

And that does so little,
that compared to the above it it 10 times slower in building muscle.

What should take a year,
will take more than 10 years with 30 lifts of heavy sets and reps.

And only when done right,
if that is even possible with the broken idea of sets and reps.

---

You would have figured all this out on your own,
if you were just left to your won thoughts.

Without some jackass from a documentary or gym,
telling how it is done.

---

You need to go back to the gym,
because you’ve never had a real workout before.

You never had a real chance,
your attempts were misinformed.

---

Now go back to the gym,
aim to start with 3 or 5 pound dumbbells.

And like a jogger, first achieve a solid one hour non stop workout,
by ever so slowly, that your body can handle, shortening your rest periods.

Find a free app called an interval timer,
it is like a stop watch, for informed joggers and bodybuilders.

To complete your long workout, use the food hikers use,
trail mix, make sure the sugar is not processed, that it is dried fruit.

And use music, without music, there can be no workout,
the drums the beat of slower songs, are an ancient trick.

When you synchronize your motion or lifting to the beat of a song,
you enter a time-shortening trance.

Exactly,
like when you are driving home from work.

Between the power of complex carbohydrates, dance trance,
weights with which you barely need to stop as you progress.

And the very fact, that you don’t have to switch machines,
to distract yourself away, and can just do multiple dumbbell exercises.

---

Those of you who don’t want to go back to the gym,
find out where the joggers are, and start walking their route with dumbbells.

But the workout, especially the light initial one is every day,
so you will need a mall or a gym, or some roof for rainy or frigid days.

Jog from time to time, and when needing to heal,
get a fat tire bicycle, or just lay down on a bench press and also start light.

---

See, you can now become muscular, trim and fit,
add many decades to your life, and become really beautiful, no matter your age.

The older you are the more handsome and distinguished you look...
as a fit, and energetic, and lets face it, wise, bodybuilder.
