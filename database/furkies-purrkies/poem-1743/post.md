Your leaders are not meant to tell you what to do,
but lead the way that is clear to the best of you.

To know where you must be headed,
you must resist side-loaded politics.

And stay withing the corridor,
that begun with philosophers, aiming to think clear.

It is a history of great beings, knights,
the Gentle Lady, and Gentleman, Intellectuals and scientists.

A history in great need of restoration,
and a great intellectual inheritance In great need of modernization.

---

Philosophers already solved poverty, fear,
stress and overwork.

They went as far as asking you,
if you’d want to re-live your life unchanged.

And if not,
then what are you doing to yourself?

High School is a great place to learn resistance,
it is your first contact with the men who sold the world.

---

You are being tricked into memorization,
because you don’t know the power of education.

You are going to have to stop pretending to learn,
and focus on learning computer programming.

Even cheap artificial intelligence can teach you,
what we have is far more than what you need.

You have to do this,
but you don’t have to be a programmer.

You just have to learn something for real,
so that you can learn to see how you have been betrayed.

---

Evey great change after High School,
will be coruppted by fake education if you let them.

You will jump head first into a world of overwork,
they will spend you, and replace you.

You need to rise on your own,
to create your own business.

Paying for more school,
is just another scam.

That is why I mention programming,
because it makes you powerful and independent.

Learn who to build web pages, and then web applications,
master JavaScript for the server and client, and just build.

---

Fake education will make you hopeless,
just exactly what the men who sold the world need.

---

The world of real education,
begins with love of wisdom and preparation for adventure.

Because only during your greatest adventures,
your mind will open to hear narrated books.

You have to walk the Triple Crown of hiking,
Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide Trails.

It will take some time to learn camping an hiking,
but it is very pleasant and full of interesting things.

---

Break away, do not let the culture crush and deform you,
break away in search of your intellectual inheritance and peace of mind.

Genius isn’t something you are born with,
it is the path through your private curiosities that takes you up.

Profound self education, today with the aid of Artificial Intelligence,
will not only make you wise, but an inventor, creator and a dignified being.

Please do not let the world deform you,
you are meant to grow all the way up until you become a great being.

The world needs you wisdom and clarity,
the future needs your greatness.
