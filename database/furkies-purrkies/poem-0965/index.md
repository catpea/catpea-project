Preface: Human Beings are not machines, they are not computer programs,
they are not sheep, or stupid, and they can't be permanently broken.

This here is a poem that uses this simple and primitive idea,
of an operating system, to explain something simply.

I use the operating system analogy,
because we are in trouble.

We have been made to think of people,
as being set in stone.

But there is no permanent label that you can attach on a human being,
because our minds are constancy expanding.

In our minds we are a young and colorful universe,
of infinite complexity and potential.

And this infinity, and complexity,
is the reason why we will now attempt to reduce that down.

To something as primitive, as an operating system,
to underline the idea that real education can upgrade the world.

---

To make things quick to understand,
for a tiny bit we must speak by somewhat questionable subtle analogy to computers.

Our minds prior to inheriting the cultures we are born to,
are supercomputers that don't have an operating system, Like Linux or Windows.

But our minds are so finely tuned by four billion years of evolution,
that we don't need a brand new copy of an operating system.

We can condense an operating system,
out of the atmosphere we grow up in.

---

Operating systems can be upgraded, sometimes when they go bad,
they can even be replaced.

In many places around the world,
Humanity is still hanging on to sometimes terrible and most often outdated ideas.

That does not mean that that part of the world should be left to it self,
but that we need to bring aid in the form of a tiny personal computer.

That will allow a person create their own educational path,
through, at the very least, beautiful and beautifully narrated books.

Shame of learning can sometimes be a massive obstacle,
to those who are bulled, as bullies will try to crush them with anything.

So it must be a tiny and free personal commuter,
and many such technologies have been around for a couple of decades now.

The lectures specifically aimed at bridging and upgrading cultures,
don't yet exist - but a series of well picked narrated books can do a great job.

---

Smartphone represents a new tool in this area,
because it allows for interactive lectures in a computer that fits in a pocket.

And does not require an external monitor,
or even a computer desk.

---

Standardized education is fake,
the same way that you not wanting to eat as a kid was fake.

At no point in your problematic-eater days,
would you ever refuse Ice Cream.

And if we use this as analogy for education,
then we want all the students getting hooked on ice cream.

Standardized education,
is failing to upgrade our operating systems, our cultures.

Because it is the same vegetable over an over again,
we cant keep eating broccoli all the time every day, every meal.

That is what standardized education does to an operating system,
it forces wrong food at the wrong time.

We don't end up eating ice cream all the time,
we move on to wiser foods as we grow in wisdom.

---

Standardized education, is hurting us,
it constantly puts broccoli in our mouth.

Or to quote Loyd Blankenship,
"we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless"

Standardized education must be replaced,
by individualized computer driven education.

And that is it,
that is all of it.

---

To upgrade all the world's cultures,
to enhance each and every individual.

Build a privacy respecting school,
where students assemble their own paths through landscapes of knowledge.

And where everyone, largely anonymously,
can solve problems over the internet, for money, for a bounty.

If a tiny startup needs a new logo,
they post a request, and a bounty of $32 dollars.

And both a 10 year old and a 50 year old,
can submit a solution.

People will be able to see why their work was not picked,
and study more about art and design, to start winning those bounties, to get at the ice cream.

---

One of the effect this world school has on the word,
is that once people realize that they are good enough or near enough to start winning bounties.

They stop being afraid of poverty,
and begin learning for real, to better themselves, to become more capable and powerful.

And that is exactly what the analogy of Operating System upgrade, or replacement represents,
self education, taking responsibility, for ones own content of character.

And rising,
and rising to no end.
