You are not servants, workers, followers, soldiers,
You are each mean to grow all the way up and become a great being.

It is hard to get started, because everyone will be pushing you,
but they don’t have your life long plan in hand.

Frankly, they want you to be a copy of somebody else,
that at the very least appears successful.

You should only listen to clear thinking secular philosophers,
and great beings who have shown to live a beautiful life.

---

You must make every day, a meaningful step,
towards growing up.

If you are still unsure where you are headed,
become a jogger, ultra-marathon runner, or a bodybuilder.

Learn programming, by following [p5.js][1] tutorials,
it is something you should do anyways.

Anything challenging is a step forward,
routine, is not.

Routine, is a mistake,
what looks like a person repeating everything.

Is actually a wise being,
going through the notions of a meaningless job.

And above all, and this is critical for mental health,
__routine is not for young people__.

You can work a job to set some money aside,
but never for long.

Three years
is your life being taken away from you.

For colored pieces of paper,
where every day of your life is more precious than all the riches of universe.

What this means is that the older you will regret,
routines that took years noway from their lives.

The wiser you will know,
that if you searched for knowledge, brilliance and wisdom first.

The future ahead of you would alter for better,
failing that, it stayed in the gray.

So all this hard work, all this effort,
would not have been necessary.

Had you chose,
to search for wisdom and adventure first.

---

Again, when all people know is overwork,
they will want you to work yourself silly.

But as you lay in a hospital bed,
overweight, with blood clots in your lungs.

You will understand that their way,
is an early death.

That they do not have great advice for you,
great advice can only come from clear thinking great beings.

Ones that know that career and life-work balance is horseshit,
as the actual balance is in nature and greatness.

---

Career is a good idea,
so as long as you are building your own outfit.

You learn programming, you invent programs,
your get investors, and learn to invent even bigger.

A career where you barely get any sleep,
and constantly live in stress…

Will not only cause mental disorders,
but also prevent you from growing up.

So, you will not know,
what you have missed, and what a curse that is.

Mental disorders start begin,
they are as simple as overeating to treat stress.

And that is just not allowed in life,
no one can put you into that.

Nor are you ever allowed,
to stay in such an environment.

---

People who say, that “This is life”,
“Wake up”, “This is reality” are already ill.

[Adventure is life][2],
books that contain your intellectual inheritance are life.

Life is always higher than misery an a work routine,
it is challenge, intention, beauty, warmth.

---

I begun this text telling you that you must grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.

And I will end it stating loud and clear,
that you are human second, and a creature of the stars first.

Your older self,
has nine very powerful words for you.

“You are fired, you are fired,
you are fired.”

Collect all the narrated books,
held in high esteem by clear thinking secular intellectuals.

And pack for the Appalachian Trail,
and aim to cross the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide as well.

Your great adventure begins,
right this moment - [go get your triple crown][3].
