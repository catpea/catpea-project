Life can get too busy,
and very quickly so.

But you can't let yourself think,
that you are merely human.

You are a creature of the cosmos,
you are the universe's way to be happy.

---

You can't let human things,
crush your cosmic things.

And adventure, not mere vacation,
but expedition.

Is how you keep the two apart,
is how you free room in your mind.

---

It is hard to notice,
that overwork crept up on you.

It is too easy,
to let your life scroll by.

That is why you need time,
under the stars.

---

Adventure is an ancient tradition,
the oldest way to think and learn.

Made more profound today,
with narrated books.

You can listen to all the Philosophers,
as you stumble, as you walk, as you grow.

---

There are great trails,
all around the world.

The Appalachian Trail,
and the Pacific Crest are especially wonderful.

But you can make your own,
you can section hike the world.

---

So as long as you are under the stars,
and listening to philosophers.

You will undo your indoctrination,
and resume where great beings left off.

So as long as you remember,
to go on adventures you will find wisdom.

---

A human being is not meant to just age,
we have to grow all the way up.

All the way, until each of us,
becomes a unique and precious great being.

Only in adventure, will you be able
to integrate your cosmic and human nature.
