---

We are not born cruel,\
we are all beautiful.

---

And a broken culture,\
is not nurture.

But a compromise,\
that destroys the wise.

---

Freedom is our right,\
the world must unite.

The culture that is worthy,\
sets the world free.

---

All must grow knowing,\
that Humanity is growing.

We are all one kind,\
leave bad ideas behind.

---

Do not lie to the younger,\
out of fear of hunger...

---

Say, poverty is an error,\
that can only cause terror.

That war cannot lead to peace,\
just a cease-fire on a lease.

That the world needs a school,\
that isn't cruel.

---

Let the younger know it all,\
advancement must not stall.

---

The things that arenâ€™t there,\
when we are born elsewhere.

Are not a big deal,\
they may not even be real.

---

The world belongs to all that are yet to come,\
and it's not a mere house, but a home.

Above all, we must all become farseeing,\
and rise to each become a Wise & Great Being.
