How To Goose Your Artificial Intelligence
Monday • November 24th 2025 • 10:20:14 pm

Programming is your first and foremost survival skill,
in the era of Artificial Intelligence.

You don’t need to learn a complex language,
only AI is allowed to write optimized software now.

What you need is the wonderfully cheerful ECMAScript,
better known as JavaScript.

As long as you know one competent language,
AI will easily translate your code into the other ones.

Don’t listen to people when they say that JavaScript was made in 10 days,
that was decades ago, and even then I bet the code was awesome.

Today it is a language so precious,
a powerful corporation is holding its name hostage.

---

As of this morning, you shouldn't learn JavaScript from first principles,
let AI create your programs first, and then look a their source code.

You will need to fix tiny bugs that confuse the AI,
add little features that you can just copy and paste in.

You will learn,
the best way possible.

---

JavaScript is an awesome language to write command line utilities in,
ask AI to help you with nodejs and your first command line utility.

Tell it to avoid npm modules, as they are too fat,
and instead create what it needs in a local modules folder.

---

Goosing is a term I invented this morning for you,
when I imagined this poem.

It is about getting your programs to stand in a row,
without harming one another, while you are learning, and beyond.

And let me show you how I Goosed my own AI this weekend,
to create a series of precious little commands.

Each a separate project on github,
without getting anything tangled up.

It all started with [piccadilly][1], program named after a road in London,
which accepts two or more images of a person making a face.

And for 15 seconds (configurable), it will randomly show the frames,
for random durations, making animations of faces appearing to speak.

I then copied piccadilly to [skedaddle][2], which means,
to hurriedly send a message, as in use a telegraph, not a horse.

And here is the big deal, I started gently building piccadilly up,
here I told the AI, that I am no longer interested in random image duration.

I instead want the animation to play,
in morse code.

Heads up everyone, as it was unclear to me, morse code is not a dot and a line,
morse code is signal and silence, the signal can be short or long.

Then I took [skedaddle][2] and I told the AI, I like Max Headroom,
add an image overlay, of a talking head to any video, creating [sardonic][3]

Once I had that overlay feature, I told the AI I now want the heads images,
open mouth and closed mouth.

And the mouth should be open,
based on audio volume, and I called that program [caricature][4].

Piccadilly, skedaddle, sardonic, and caricature,
each represent an evolutionary step in creating an automatic lipsync generator.

Each is a fun little program, precious in its own way,
and each can now be separately upgraded.

And without causing any interference,
to each of your major steps.

And again, just to repeat,
AI does all the programming.

You just need to remember to say that it needs to be simple and lightweight,
full of helpful comments and easy to understand.

And then be ready to look for bugs, tell the AI what is broken, or not quite right,
and give it time for thought, consideration, and multiple tries.

Again, artificial intelligence, has received an upgrade,
to its ability to think, and it can synthesize answers that are not on the internet.

That are buried in documentation, in old code,
throw away files and backups.

The future is now,
begin programming with your AI immediately.
