Not With A Whimper
Thursday • July 24th 2025 • 5:06:38 pm

In the gray parade of days identical,
where desire feeds on desire's empty bowl,
where we are puppets to a blind Will's pull—
slaves to comfort, to the predictable—

But wait. If Will is all, then Will can turn
against its own dull repetition's curse.
The very force that makes us slaves can burn
through mediocrity's rehearsed verse.

Rise, then! Not to escape the Will, but be
its conscious lightning, its awakened form.
Transform the hunger into artistry,
make suffering birth the extraordinary storm.

The masses sleep in Will's unconscious dream—
but you can wake, and make the darkness gleam.

They say, they think, they do—the faceless "they"—
and so we follow, lost in idle talk,
absorbed in screens, in comfort's soft decay,
mere shadows who have forgotten how to walk.

This average everydayness kills the soul,
this falling into what "one does" and "should."
We flee from death by playing the safe role,
mistaking the inauthentic for the good.

But Dasein calls! Your being-toward-death waits
to shatter all pretense of the secure.
Anxiety breaks open Being's gates—
only in facing void can you be sure

that you exist. Choose yourself against the crowd.
Stand naked in your truth. Live death aloud.

---

"I am what I am"—the coward's plea,
hiding behind false essence like a wall.
"Just human nature," "That's just me,"
excuses that make slaves of us all.

Condemned to freedom, yet we choose our chains,
prefer the comfort of the pre-defined.
We act our roles while existence wanes,
bad faith the poison of the modern mind.

But you are nothing till you make yourself!
No essence waits—existence leads the way.
Cast off the masks upon the social shelf,
create your meaning fresh with every day.

The anguish of pure freedom is the price
of being more than society's device.

The herd seeks only pleasure, flees from pain,
represses every drive that might disturb
their careful equilibrium's refrain,
sublimating greatness to the suburb.

They live in compromise, in half-desires,
their super-ego keeping id in check,
never knowing their unconscious fires,
shipwrecked souls upon normality's deck.

But dare to know your depths! Let id speak loud,
not in mere hedonism's shallow pool,
but channeled into works that shake the crowd—
sublimation as a transformative...

...hinks what everyone thinks, and calls this rabble-wisdom "being informed." He has never had a thought that made him dizzy, never felt an idea that threatened to shatter his world—and he is *proud* of this poverty!

And their highest aspiration? To be "nice"! To cause no offense! To rock no boats! They have made a supreme value of *harmlessness*—as if the absence of vigor were itself virtuous! They congregate in their committees and their communities, these last men, reinforcing each other's mediocrity, awarding prizes for the most successful maintenance of the status quo. "Another day without excellence!" they might as well cheer. "Another year without disturbing the peace of our putrefaction!"

But thou who hast ears to hear—canst thou not perceive the comedy? These creatures who fear solitude because they cannot bear their own company, who fear silence because it might reveal their emptiness, who fear greatness because it exposes their own refusal to grow—they dare to legislate for the eagles! They dare to say what is "reasonable," what is "balanced," what is "healthy"! The sick prescribing medicine to the vital! The halt and lame establishing the rules for dancers!

Oh, let them have their "life-work balance" and their "sustainable pace" and their "realistic expectations"! Let them cuddle together in their support groups, validating each other's decision to remain larvae! But for those with blood still hot enough to boil, with spirits still wild enough to hunger—know that their tolerance is *fear*, their inclusivity is *envy*, their community is *conspiracy against greatness*.

The war is ancient but the battle is NOW! Every moment thou choosest comfort over growth, thou dost betray every ancestor who bled to make thee possible. Every time thou seekest the average, the median, the "normal," thou dost spit upon the grave of every genius who suffered to expand what is human.

Rise, or be forever complicit in humanity's heat-death! Create, or be counted among the graves that walk! The mediocre have always been the majority—but since when did the eagle take voting advice from sheep?

Let the world grow—but it grows only through those who grow beyond it! The rest? Let them tend their little gardens of adequacy. We have mountains to make.
