Remembering Saints, And Never Forgetting The Names Enemies

Before there were transcripts, seals, and verdicts, there was a girl who laughed easily.

Those who knew Joan did not begin with theology. They began with motion. She walked quickly, as if time were a thing one could misplace. In Domrémy, a village small enough that everyone’s business belonged to everyone else, she was known first as dependable—someone who finished tasks without complaint. She spun wool. She tended animals. She went to church more often than most, but without the stiffness that makes devotion look like ambition. If you asked her neighbors what set her apart, they hesitated. *Nothing*, they might say at first. And then, after a pause, *well—there was something*.

They remembered how she listened. Not in the polite way children are taught, but with an intensity that made adults recalibrate their sentences. When she spoke, she did not hedge. This was unsettling, because certainty is usually purchased with education or rank, and Joan had neither. Her parents loved her in the practical way peasants love their children: by worrying constantly. Jacques d’Arc, her father, dreamed of her running away with soldiers and woke in fear. Isabelle Romée, her mother, taught her prayers and later carried those prayers all the way to Rome, as if distance itself might be persuaded.

To the soldiers who followed her, Joan was not a symbol at first. She was inconveniently real. She asked them to confess. She sent prostitutes away from camp. She refused coarse jokes and worse behavior, not with sermons, but with a look that made men feel briefly smaller than their better selves. They admired her because she made demands without humiliating them. Courage, they noticed, did not always raise its voice.

She rode badly at first. This detail survives because it mattered to those who watched her learn. Knights noticed that she held the reins too tightly, that she sat like someone bracing against a fall. And then, a little later, they noticed she no longer did. Learning, in her case, was fast and unapologetic. She did not pretend she had always known how. That honesty bred loyalty more effectively than bravado ever could.

To Charles VII, she was both relief and embarrassment. He tested her, of course—men in power always do. He hid among...

... This is how institutions endure.

What followed was not thunder, not fire from heaven. It was something quieter. The English lost France anyway—by 1453, almost entirely. Henry VI, for whom this trial was staged, descended into mental collapse and was murdered in the Tower of London in 1471. John of Bedford died in 1435, his alliances unraveling. Philip the Good of Burgundy changed sides and prospered. And Pierre Cauchon? He died peacefully in 1442, promoted, unpunished, his conscience unrecorded. Justice, it seems, does not distribute consequences evenly.

Twenty-five years later, the Church reopened the case. This is where the record begins to whisper. Witnesses suddenly remembered pressure, guards, threats. The verdict was annulled. The trial was declared corrupt. Notice what did *not* happen: no punishments, no dramatic penance. The institution corrected the paperwork, not the people. It looked upward, toward its own continuity, even as it admitted error. One learns a great deal from what an institution is willing to confess—and what it quietly forgives.

Joan’s crime was never witchcraft. That was a word, a tool, a costume put on violence. Her real offense was structural. *Her existence exposed the fragility of political theology.* A peasant girl hearing God disrupted the idea that authority flows neatly from crown to altar. *Her appeals threatened ecclesiastical procedure.* She treated the Church as something higher than its local representatives, which is doctrinally correct and politically intolerable. *Her symbolism outpaced institutional control.* Armies can be beaten; symbols cannot be imprisoned for long.

It is tempting to look back and say we would have acted differently. I am not sure. The trial worked because it felt reasonable to those inside it. It had forms, citations, footnotes. Evil rarely announces itself; it drafts memoranda. The men involved—Pierre Cauchon, Jean Le Maître, Guillaume Erard—did not see themselves as villains. That may be the most instructive detail of all.

Her judges tried to make her an error to be corrected. History refused. The record remains, names attached, actions preserved. A woman was killed by men who believed procedure could outrun truth.

It did not. And it never quite does.
