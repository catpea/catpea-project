Workout instruction, is simple,
but it can be tough to understand at first.

The common ideas of sets and reps,
and lifting towards heavy are mistakes.

And they shut you down, while convincing you,
that they work by only letting you adapt once.

When you go from no workout,
to the wrong Set/Rep workout that everyone is doing.

But since the weight are too heavy,
you can’t lift for longer, and you’ll never lift heaver.

Use standing dumbbell exercises only,
using dumbbells while you twist and turn, is a full body exercise.

The machines at the gym, are for when you are badly hurt,
and if you use them for no reason at all, they will cause harm.

Because when you sit down or lay down,
you nullify 98% of your exercise.

You just work on two spots in your musculature,
it is like honking a horn versus conducting an orchestra.

The elderly, who lost muscle through a sedimentary lifestyle,
get in a lot trouble form these machines.

The result of using the machines,
is prevention your body from developing muscle.

Compared to walking with with wrist and ankle weights,
the machines are awful, they slow you down and hold you back.

The elderly walking at the mall in the morning,
get a much better full body workout.

And if they carry dumbbells, or wrist/angle weights,
or maybe a weight vest…

So as long as they add more weights, as their body adapts,
they will be bodybuilding – imagine that.

The gym and the mall is all about the roof,
and restrooms.

Or weather control,
and not traumatizing people monitoring the trail-cameras.

But, a large parks, woodland trails,
or park roads roads with safe sidewalks, are superior.

Temperature is cooler, air is fresher,
and the scenery around you is always changing, helping with focus.

In short,
outdoor dumbbells.

And your exercise should begin,
with jogging, while hanging on to the lightest of dumbbells.

Once you are able to jog for an hour with 3 or 5 pounds per hand,
you then move up in weight, but by no more than 2.5 pounds.

The rule I invented is as follows,
start in the beginning of the dumbbell rack.

Lift light, but not so light that you can handle more,
and never so heavy, that you are forced to stop.

The jogging is a leadin into an athletic lifestyle,
it helps you build up that much needed hour’s worth of endurance.

Sets and reps force you to lift heavy for one minute,
but to progress you must lift for an hour, whatever you can handle.

Your body will quickly get used to the challenge,
and adapt to handle even more, and that is when you go up in weight.

You need slow songs at first, if you go fast,
you will ruin your exercise by stopping too frequently - even with light weights.

At first, you can just tell slow for fast by ear,
so assemble a slow playlist for your initial workouts.

But eventually you will need to speed up your music,
for the current set of weights you are lifting.

Speed of music,
is measured in beats per minute, or BPMs.

And you can find apps and musician gadgets,
that allow you to tap the beats out with your finger.

And the computer will calculate the BPM,
for you.

But in a pinch,
romance and country is slow, pop & rock is medium, and techno is fast.

You may be able to use in-ear headphones,
if you don’t have a speaker overhead.

If your gym music is too loud,
or something else is already interrupting your focus.

You will need earplugs and over the ear studio headphones,
to mask the gym music, and just hear your own.

As a bonus, you protect your ears,
our ears are not meant to be headphone close to speakers.

Music is a big deal, because when you move to the beat,
something that can be referred to as subtle dancing.

You enter a dance trance, as your brain gets busy and transfixed,
by synchronizing your motion to music with somewhat challenging weights.

If your music is not slow enough, you get kicked out of the trance,
by being forced to stop.

Do that enough, and an hour’s worth of lifting,
will approximate feel like 14 hours.

Now let me summarize,
what we have talked about.

You need a full-body exercise,
that means twisting and turning with dumbbells.

The exercise must last one hour non-stop,
large people will require more to use up their stored reserves.

The simplest way to gain an hour’s worth of endurance,
is just by slowly jogging.

You should use the lightest of dumbbells,
until you can handle more.

But it is not just lightest of dumbbells,
it is also, the slow songs that help you go non-stop.

Which will induce a dance trance,
or a meditative state where time time passes much faster.

Lastly, as you adapt,
you continue making your exercise more challenging.
