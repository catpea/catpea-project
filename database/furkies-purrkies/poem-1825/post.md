Frequently resting during your workout,
is very often a sign of trouble.

And the trouble almost always is,
endurance, the power that deals with duration.

Which is built up gradually,
with much lower weights.

In order to eliminate rest,
and then restart with light weights.

Not so light that you can lift more,
but not so heavy that you must stop.

---

When we ignore the duration,
of our exercise, and focus on weight.

We end up not lifting.
for long enough.

And our bodies don’t adapt,
as quickly as they could.

---

Sets and reps,
are unfortunately a myth.

Likely made up based on,
how bodybuilders act in front of cameras.

In reality, they aim to lift,
for multiple hours.

And that can only be accomplished,
by lifting light at first.

Waiting for the body,
to get used to it.

Which is to say,
grow more muscle.

And only then,
when the body is ready.

Moving up higher in weight,
challenging it anew,

Nd restarting,
the process.

---

To repair your workout,
switch to dumbbell exercises.

Which allow your muscles,
to adapt in correct sequence.

And then cycle dumbbell exercises,
to allow muscle groups to rest.

But with the aim to eliminate rest,
exactly how joggers do it.

Only once you don’t need to rest,
with 3 or 5 lb dumbbells.

You can think about going up higher,
and only by about 2.5 pounds.

---

Eventually you arrive at 25 per hand,
for multiple hours.

And adapting so quickly that,
you need to start thinking about easing up.

Because you are doing,
a standing exercise.

You are engaging your entire body,
and your physique is always perfect.

There is no need,
for muscle isolation.

---

I recommend you consider,
shuffle dancing with dumbbells.

As a maintenance exercise,
and perhaps make a workout program.

And of course,
say with it for the long life ahead.

---

From a broader perspective,
bodybuilding is a kind of jogging.

But you gently keep adding weights,
as your body adapts to handle the hour or two.

---

You can use an interval timer to,
eliminate the initial rest.

Test how long you can lift 3 or 5 pounds for,
and how long you need to rest to do it again.

And then set the rounds,
to fill an hour.

And as your body adapts,
shorten the rest periods, to eliminate them.

---

And you have to learn to move,
to the beat of music.

Don’t just listen to songs,
lift to the beat.

One beat up, next beat down,
you can see how dancing is somewhat related.

And as you move to a higher weight,
switch to slower songs for a while.

This will help you adjust to the new heavy,
without unnecessary stops.

The point of moving to the beat,
is entering a dance trance.

That keeps you focused,
and makes time pass faster.

If someone is annoying you,
try learning programming.

Always taking a lesson to the gym,
that always works to tune out distractions.

---

In summary, fitness and bodybuilding,
is just gradual, endurance-driven adaptation to higher weights.

And music, especially fresh and crisp songs,
will help you stay in focus, and pass time faster.
