I hope that I don’t come across as a hater,
but somebody has to say it sooner than later.

Don't let your child grow up as corporate knob,
buy them a Stable Diffusion rig so they won't need an office job.

Throw your computer out the window,
because the damn thing is too slow.

I remember the first time I realized my computer was slow,
no matter how I wrote my program it just wouldn't go.

---

The world is changing right meow, be smart,
computers can now identify, describe, and re-generate art.

You really need a powerful computer,
a bazooka, not a peashooter.

Not since the Commodore, not since the Wolfenstein,
has anything close to this been seen.

---

And I am sorry,
but the cats who built this, do not see the full story.

The only way to understand this, was to open source,
and let things run their course.

---

While this computer program has some smarts,
that is not when the party really starts.

It makes way to many errors, because we can’t say “it knows”,
this program does not think, it just kind of grows.

---

So much anger is headed towards these programs,
that all your art should start with your hand drawn diagrams.

To avoid all the AI hate,
don’t just tell it what to create,

Create the initial doodle on your own,
and then feed it the picture you take with your phone.

Letting the computer reinterpret it into various styles,
this will bring a lot of happy smirks and smiles.

---

Tell your parents not to wait for holidays,
knowing Stable Diffusion really pays.

Tell them not to be a snail,
because this thing can generate beautiful products for sale.

You need to understand and start collecting files right now,
tell your parents to shake it and, meow (now).

---

This here is the Wild, Wild Best, from Camera Obscura, to Camera Lucida,
and now to Camera Futura.

No child should grow up without having mastered Stable Diffusion,
they must know how to use it without any confusion.

---

Parents, do not delay,
order a powerful computer today.
