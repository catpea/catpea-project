The great feats our bodies are capable of,
are possible because of our superpower of endurance.

You can’t hurry endurance, it develops at its own speed,
you have to be respectful of it or the workout will become impossible.

---

The useless myth of Sets and Reps,
is an example of disrespecting endurance.

People lift too heavy, too quickly,
the body loses the ability to adapt, because it is too much.

People come to the gym and lift 15 or 20 pound dumbbells,
because that is what they can lift 10 times.

Ten times is better than zero,
so muscles will grow a tiny bit.

But being unable to progress to 15 times,
because of how heavy the weight already is.

The person will hit a plateau,
and stay there, merely maintaining what little they have.

Disrespecting endurance,
means disabling it.

Turning off the key power,
that helps our bodies adapt, destroys the workout.

---

Being respectful of endurance,
means starting in the beginning, with 3 or 5 lb weight.

Asking how long can I lift this for to the steady beat of music,
and how long do I need to rest to do it again and again.

And then simply focusing on shortening those rest periods,
while being respectful of endurance, until rest is no longer needed.

And after a few weeks, mixing in the higher weight dumbbells,
until you can lift those for the duration of your entire workout.

---

You have to slowly increase your workout duration as well,
start with 15 minutes, 25 minutes, 45 minutes, and then 60, 90…

And if you need to burn fat 120,
obese males may need to do 180 minutes 5-7 days a week, but rarely more.

---

Going faster than endurance allows,
causes pain, discomfort, and eventually stop s the workout way too short.

You should also know that pain in the first few weeks,
is temporary, it goes away, once you get past it a workout does not hurt.

The muscles hurt, because when you are not working out,
they enter a strange sickly state, where they become useless.

First few weeks at the gym, re-awakens them,
it reboots them, it activates them.

You become much healthier for it,
your body starts working as it should.

---

Finally,
how should your body work?

You need to be able to run marathons,
throughout your entire life.

You slow down in your 80s,
but you are still able to beet the crap out of fat teenagers.

You are kind of supposed to function towards the maximum,
of your your body allows, slowing down in your 80s.

You don’t have to be an Olympic level runner,
but if you push yourself there, you will live longer.

We are animals, I am sorry,
but this is a very important truth.

If you keep a horse in the stable,
it will become deformed and die.

A horse needs to exercise,
it needs to extend its endurance to live long and healthy.

Put a human on a couch,
and the human will become deformed and die early.

---

Your job wants you in that office chair,
because the day that kills you, they just hire somebody else.

Just because everything that surrounds you wants to drain you of life,
does not mean that this is the human lifestyle.

---

For your mind, you need to listen to thousands of narrated books,
written by non-religious clear thinkers who loved life and lived well.

For your body, you need adventure, jogging, hiking, state park camping,
section hiking the Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails.

Again, nothing supports this lifestyle,
but you have to fight for it.

To be clear, you may only work 9 months a year,
every three months spending a month in nature.

You have to make this happen,
no one else is going to take care of your body and mind.

You need distant horizons,
fresh air, exercise.

And time for new books, self education,
and thinking about who you are, where you want to be, and where life is taking you.

---

This is your life,
you only get one.

You have to take care of yourself,
fight for it if you must.

A career is a pretty stupid choice to make,
if it kills you at 50, where you could have lived until your 90s.

If being a great employee, or having a good career,
cuts your lifespan in half.

It is a pretty stupid choice to make,
just ask your elder self on their final day.

You must take care,
of your body and mind.

And your aim should be growing all the way up,
until you become a great being.
