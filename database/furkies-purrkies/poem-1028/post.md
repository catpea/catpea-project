I have a strange little tradition,
where if there is time, I write little programs for holidays.

While I haven't come up with any ideas yet,
I remembered an interesting programming environment.

It is the world of UserScripts,
facilitated by the [Greasemonkey][1] web browser add-on.

---

It is the quick and little programs,
that get you.

If you are programming,
like a normal person…

You can expect,
a normal environment.

Where things will go,
as you would normally expect them to go.

---

But if you start programming,
without preparation... sideways, in something new.

It will most likely be,
quite an educational experience.

---

If all you do to learn programming is write normal programs,
things can get pretty boring.

But if you challenge yourself to,
for example [create a screensaver in P5.js][0].

You’ll learn something new,
while having a pretty interesting time.

---

My idea is to establish a communication channel,
between my web operating system and  Greasemonkey.

[Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey has some extra privileges][2],
like downloading data from external domains.

One of the fundamental features,
of an operating system.

---

To this day my favorite Potato program was a JavaScript,
running under the Rhino JavaScript Engine…

That controlled Android’s Java API,
and told me how long to work out to increase my endurance.

I wrote a crude Interval timer,
in the gym parking lot, by using a little android phone.

---

While it seems,
like something that would hardly present any lessons, and quickly become annoying.

It helped me see Android API or function calls,
in a universal way through the eyes of multiple programming languages.

In part because of it, when I created my web OS terminal,
I did not bother with creating special room for commands.

Instead, when I type in a command and press enter,
I emit an event named after the command,

With command arguments as it payload data,
and without caring if there is something listening for that command.

My little terminal became a universal way,
to dispatch events into my Operating System event bus.

The bus, can be connected to a server, or a network,
so the terminal with just one life of code can control everything.

What started off as a Potato Program ages ago,
ended up becoming a pretty nifty line of code.
