they said
*this will prepare you for life*
and we believed them
because we were young
and belief comes easy
before the bills do.

classrooms smelled like dust
and surrender.
chalk, fear,
and old men
who’d already lost
and wanted company.

they taught us
how to follow instructions
without understanding them.
how to wait.
how to ask permission
to breathe.

and later—
surprise—
we were very good at it.

we became assistants
to people dumber than us.
servants with clipboards.
smiling help
for the advantaged,
holding doors open
for inherited confidence.

they called it a career.

some of us put on uniforms—
because obedience
translates well to war.
march here.
shoot there.
don’t think too much
about who profits
when the smoke clears.

they didn’t teach us
how to judge,
only how to comply.
so we learned fast
how to kill on command
and slow
how to live with it.

others of us ended up broke—
not the romantic kind,
the real kind.
the kind where talent rots
on night shifts
and genius pours coffee
for people who say
*I almost did something once*.

poverty isn’t just empty pockets.
it’s exhausted minds.
it’s having no energy left
to imagine a way out.
they never taught us
how to imagine—
just how to endure.

and that was the trick.

education that doesn’t awaken
doesn’t fail by accident.
it produces silence.
it produces debt.
it produces citizens
who confuse survival
with living.

they broke promises early.
said knowledge was power
then hid power behind doors
we weren’t taught to open.
said think for yourself
then punished us
when we tried.

abuse of trust
over and over
until mistrust feels normal
and apathy feels safe.

by the time we noticed,
we were tired.
too tired to ask
why the world felt stalled.
why the same idiots
kept winning.
why nothing ever changed
except the price of rent
and the body count.

that’s how humanity
doesn’t grow up.
not with a bang—
but with worksheets,
dead lessons,
and a quiet agreement
not to rock the boat
that’s already leaking.

some of us wake up anyway.

some of us feel the rage
under the numbness.
realize the boredom
was a warning,
not a flaw.
realize the betrayal
wasn’t personal—
it was structural.

and once you see it,
you’re responsible.

no diploma
can save you now.
no excuse either.

you either keep kneeling—
in cubicles,
in trenches,
in lines for food
and meaningless approval—

or you stand
and learn like your life
depends on it.

because it does.

think.
question.
unlearn the obedience.
teach yourself what matters.

become dangerous
to systems that need you small.

rise—
not polished,
not perfect,
but awake—

until we stop producing servants,
stop feeding wars,
stop mistaking misery
for maturity.

rise
until humanity finally does
what it should have learned
the first time:

how to grow up.

---

let’s stop lying.

you knew
something was wrong
when you memorized answers
you didn’t believe
and called it learning.

you knew
when curiosity felt dangerous,
when silence felt safer,
when passing mattered more
than understanding.

you knew—
and you played along.

that’s the part
no one likes to say out loud.

pretending to learn
isn’t harmless.
it isn’t neutral.
it doesn’t just waste time.

it trains you
to accept things
you don’t understand
and defend them anyway.

that’s how servants are made.
not with chains—
with credentials.

you end up working for people
who can’t think
but learned how to advance.
you take orders
that feel wrong
but sound official.
you tell yourself
*this is just how it is*
while something in you
rots quietly.

and when the uniform comes—
military, corporate, ideological—
you put it on easily.
because you’ve been rehearsing
obedience
since childhood.

wars don’t run on monsters.
they run on graduates
who never learned
how to say no
to authority
with a straight face.

poverty doesn’t just come
from lack of money.
it comes from lack of agency.
from never being taught
how to think your way out
instead of waiting
to be rescued.

this is where it gets ugly:

every time you pretend to learn,
you help keep the machine alive.
every time you pass without caring,
you pass the damage forward.
every time you confuse compliance
with competence,
you weaken the future.

bridges collapse.
systems fail.
people die.
not because no one was educated—
but because too many were
trained instead.

this is how civilizations decay:
experts who never questioned,
leaders who never thought,
citizens who never practiced judgment
until it was too late.

and don’t hide behind youth.
don’t hide behind exhaustion.
don’t hide behind
*I didn’t know*.

at some point,
you did.

once you see the emptiness,
pretending becomes a choice.
and that choice
has consequences.

you don’t get to inherit
everything others bled for—
science, rights, fragile progress—
and then sleepwalk through it
without breaking it.

that’s the deal.
that’s the cost.

either you learn for real—
messy, uncomfortable,
without permission—

or you help destroy
what you were never brave enough
to understand.

so don’t fake it anymore.
don’t sit quietly
while your mind goes soft.
don’t nod along
while the world asks for judgment
and you offer credentials.

stand up.
think hard.
risk being wrong.
risk being slow.
risk being alone.

because the alternative
is not harmless.

the alternative
is collapse
wearing a graduation gown.

rise—
not later,
not when it’s convenient—

rise now,
and become worthy
of what you’ve been given,
