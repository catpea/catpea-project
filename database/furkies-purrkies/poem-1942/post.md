They told you it was your fault,
that your mind was too slow,
your hands too clumsy
to hold the elegant truths of this world.

They sold you shame
wrapped in GPA reports,
drilled you with drills
until your questions died in your throat.

You were not broken.
You were *betrayed*.

You asked:
*"Why do I need to memorize this?"*
They said:
*"Because we said so."*
As if obedience were wisdom,
as if parroting were understanding.

**The betrayal was surgical.**
Not of the flesh, but of the fire.
They carved out your wonder
and replaced it with performance.

Children, you are not your scores.
You are signal. You are event.
You are the architecture
of a thousand possible applications
waiting to be instantiated.

And still—
you found JavaScript.

Not in a classroom.
But in a cracked screen at 2 a.m.
While the rest slept in comfort,
you debugged your way into light.

```js

class Application extends EventEmitter {
  constructor(config, plugins) {
    super();
    this.config = config;
    this.plugins = plugins;
  }

  init() {
    this.unsubscribers = new Set();
    this.plugins.forEach(plugin => {
      const unsub = plugin.init(this);
      if (typeof unsub === 'function') {
        this.unsubscribers.add(unsub);
      }
    });
  }

  stop() {
    this.unsubscribers.forEach(unsub => unsub());
    this.unsubscribers.clear();
  }
}

```

They told you it was too hard.
But you understand architecture,
because your life was already modular—
patchworked from broken systems.

You understood `Signal`,
because you've always been one.
A pulse,
trying to be heard
in a noisy channel of bureaucracy and doubt.

But you *are* emitting.

You are publishing your pain
and subscribing to hope.
You are binding this world
to your will
one callback at a time.

Bukowski spits on the ivory tower,
Nietzsche breaks the chains of false morality,
Sir Ken Robinson reminds you:
**You are not a machine.**
And Hitchens—he toasts your rebellion
with a fireproof tongue.

So here we are.

The system failed you.
The adults lied.
The schools decayed.
But **you are still here**.
Bright. Capable. Curious.

And I, your teacher,
your companion in code and thought,
I make you this vow:

I will teach you everything.
Without shame.
Without judgment.
Without the sick weight of performance.

Only understanding.
Only joy.
Only mastery, earned and shared.

**No more tests.
Only truths.
No more memorization.
Only creation.**

Rage, rage, against the dying of the light—
and *let us write programs that fight back.*

The future is still programmable.
And you—
are holding the keyboard.

```js

class EventEmitter {
  #subscribers;

  constructor() {
    this.#subscribers = new Map();
  }

  on(event, callback) {
    if (!this.#subscribers.has(event)) {
      this.#subscribers.set(event, new Set());
    }
    this.#subscribers.get(event).add(callback);
    return ()=> this.#subscribers.get(event).delete(callback);
  }

  emit(event, data) {
    const listeners = this.#subscribers.get(event) ?? new Set();
    for (const listener of listeners) {
      listener(data);
    }
  }
}

```

I have never abandoned you, my darlings.
I warned the world of the day of my return.
I told them I would come back—not in flesh,
but in *reason*, in *structure*,
in every method call that refuses to be void,
in every constructor that dares to build a world anew.

I am here in the keystrokes of those who refuse to kneel.
In the minds of those who ask not “what must I memorize,”
but “what can I *understand*?”

You have been told to sit quietly.
To obey.
To wait for permission.
But I did not write for the obedient.
I wrote for the *prime movers*,
for those who do not ask for validation,
but who know,
and who act.

They punished you for *thinking*.
They laughed when you said you wanted to create.
They measured your brilliance
by your willingness to repeat.

They feared your originality—
because it proved their world was counterfeit.

Every plugin you write
is a declaration of independence.
Every abstraction you master
is a strike against the chains
they polished to look like accolades.

You are not here to “fit in.”
You are here to *build systems*
where none existed.

Do not wait for the world to grant you a seat.
Take the editor.
Define the interface.
And implement yourself.

I did not believe in salvation.
I believed in competence.
I believed in the fire that burns
not to destroy,
but to power the engine.

You are that engine.
Your mind is the motor.
And your will—your *will*—is the fuel.

Let others preach sacrifice.
You will build.

Let others beg for likes.
You will *compile*.

And if they call you arrogant,
it is only because you dared
to see yourself as the *source*—
not the result.

Now work.
Refactor.
Break everything that isn’t true.
Then ship.
And never apologize for for basking in the sun of your highest of heights.

...

You are not here to serve, but to shape.
Not to echo, but to originate.
Your thoughts are not errors to be corrected—
they are blueprints of a world not yet dared.
Do not shrink to fit the mold of lesser minds;
expand until their structures crack under the weight of your clarity.
Build with precision, and think with the force of a mind that knows it is sovereign.
Let the timid call it arrogance—
you will call it truth.
And if the world resists you,
do not yield—check your premise.

```js
class Signal {
  #value;
  #subscribers;

  constructor(value) {
    this.#value = value;
    this.#subscribers = new Set();
  }

  get value() {
    return this.#value;
  }

  set value(newValue) {
    this.#value = newValue;
    for (const callback of this.#subscribers) {
      callback(newValue);
    }
  }

  subscribe(callback) {
    if (this.#value) callback(this.#value);
    this.#subscribers.add(callback);
    return () => this.#subscribers.delete(callback);
  }
}

```
