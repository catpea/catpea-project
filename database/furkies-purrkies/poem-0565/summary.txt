The Great Challenges
Thursday • September 16th 2021 • 8:45:37 pm

There cannot exist a Manual Of Life,\
because each and everyone of us represents a unique story that can’t be summarized.

We each make unique decisions,\
based on our previous experiences.

Some years ago, I was called to Jury Duty,\
and wanting to learn more about it I've read [Michelle Alexander's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw) book.

I once wanted to be a Judge,\
but that book changed my opinion about our Criminal Justice System.

I will use my struggle to comprehend what has happened,\
in this text, to demonstrate how Great Beings like Michelle Alexander change the world.

How challenges transform us, and transform within us,\
how they enter stories like this poem, so that they are never forgotten.

And as we grow in wisdom,\
we will add to the gravity of the situation so that the changes that the world needs will come sooner.

Overall, we can say that you are supposed to bring on an age,\
in which students can trust teachers with real education.

This age will result in a massive increase in the global education level,\
the kids will take care of the rest.

You are just as important as the world,\
you deserve an early retirement, cheerful days, and a happy life.

I am asking you to think in terms of multiple generations,\
no one person should be made to suffer the mistakes of the world.

You contributions need “legs” as [Loyd Blankenship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEnnvZbYek) calls it,\
it is probably an audio book.

If you like,\
you can give speeches like [Richard Dawkins](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Richard+Dawkins) or [Brene Brown](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Brene+Brown).

To write that book,\
you need to get at truths in life.

You need to arrange them in a coherent network,\
that will help others understand the world a bit better.

As you learn you will become passionate about certain things that move you,\
Ecology, Mass Incarceration, Human Rights, Real Education, Real Growing-up.

The things that you are most passionate about,\
with enhance the things that you have learned from other Great Beings.

When you comprehend Indoctrination,\
you will see that criminals are not really themselves when committing crimes in their youth.

They are still deadly, but they...

....youtube.com/watch?v=fCvX1IBvK2c) or [devastated by depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyogyD7vXbw), will become perfectly beautiful.

The people we call criminals, victims of indoctrination,\
the stuff clouding their judgment just emerged out of poverty, lack of education, desperation, fear, hunger, loneliness, harm and hurt.

[Prisons are places that punish and harm even more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5hmP9STe-g),\
this is not what people who were not acting of their own volition need.

Those kinds of people need to be unindoctrinated,\
they need to be brought into our world, into our reality.

If you were to write such a book speaking about criminals as victims of indoctrination,\
it would up in the hands of inmates, prison officials, guards, politicians.

And small changes would begin to happen,\
as more and more people would see that we’ve been sending our children to prison due to our own blindness, and lack of foresight.

---

Such a book would not just influence prisons,\
but add to the gravity of all other good changes that are queued-up in the world.

On this case you would have two types of changes,\
helping inmates out of their alien world, and and preventing people from ending up in prisons.

Dealing with existing inmates,\
which would require converting prisons to schools in the hope of undoing their indoctrination.

And prevention, which attacks the indoctrination it self,\
this adds gravity to universal basic income programs, and to [real education programs such as Will Richardson hints on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY) and changes that [Michelle Alexander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw), [Kandice Sumner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O7BMa9XGXE) and [Duncan Campbell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK2OPkz2LTM)

---

Break away from all that you know, and reject fake education,\
and begin learning for real from hundreds or even thousands of the wisest books-and-narrated-books you can find at your library.

Search for entire lifetimes of knowledge and wisdom,\
look for adventures, biographies, storytellers, philosophers.

And become a Independent Great Being,\
because the thing that **you** need to do, lies just past the tipping point between your Wisdom and your Greatness.
