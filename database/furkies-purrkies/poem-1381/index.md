Adults may argue, but then they will turn around,
and give each other advice that consists of little more than:

“Trust your instinct” or,
“Go with your gut feeling”.

Crappy advice to bear no responsibility for results,
yes, but it entails trusting feelings.

As a student you are told to distrust your feelings,
and give up your and your parent’s savings.

The best advice in both instances is to use your brain,
and that means, you can only learn what brings you satisfaction.

And that in turn translates to, learning new things,
at your pace, and more importantly in a sequence that fits your existing knowledge.

That is the second sign of a fake school,
you are presented knowledge cut up and out of sequence.

Where you can only temporary memorize,
which looks great on tests.

This is happening,
because cunning old ghouls noticed something.

They noticed, you will go to school without asking,
without asking if the education there is effective.

And as a result, and since teachers get paid just the same,
all schools became ineffective.

---

These are the same ghouls that have used and tolerated indoctrination,
that kept medicine prices high, that ended your privacy, and even rolled back civil right.

Those are the same ghouls that legalize drugs,
and criminalize a woman’s right to make her own choices.

---

Listen here,
and listen carefully.

Because these same creeps,
will force you to become a certifies forklift operator…

And not even pay attention,
when those jobs are replaced by highly skilled and numerous machines.

---

You need real skills that will protect you in the future,
those skills are not going to be physical, but intellectual.

There are very few powerful aims,
when all you have is fake education.

But it just so happens,
that programming, the most powerful aim, is perfectly accessible.

Before you point fingers, argue with ghouls, search for evidence,
learn programming, start with JavaScript.

Over the years, try Rust, Go, C++, C,
and the others, though make sure they are open source, don’t be a tool.

---

This is something that stays safe in your mind for life,
that you can learn on your own, that you can be proud of.

There are no diplomas, no resumes here, many don’t stay in the office for long,
you go home create a series of small side projects, and you’ll be safe.

You should create new things,
but you can just re-create what sells at first, it is a good start to learning.

---

Keep it in your mind, practice often,
and once you are there.

Then you can go jump hoops for a diploma,
so as long as you have a real education, you can toy with ineffective education.

When you had your fill,
build a school that works.

It is your duty,
to help the future.

Every person is mean to t grow all the way up,
until with effective knowledge, great adventure, well narrated books, and love of wisdom.

They rise,
to become a great being.

Do you hear? Learn for real,
don’t let the men who sold the world, sell you too.

Become a great, enlightened being,
and may the ghouls of your era cower in their shadows and lies.
