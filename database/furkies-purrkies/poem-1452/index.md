In Michigan, Spring is a thing,
that the birds bring.

We don’t wait,
for the date.

And it was announced to me today,
that today is the day.

---

There are many curiosities here,
and much of Michigan holds them dear.

For example, while all the birds are back again,
not all birds __fly__ to Michigan.

Many get transported by colorful trucks,
especially the ducks.

And, you can always tell it’s the ducks,
because you can hear all the quacks.

---

It is not just the birds,
that suddenly pop up in herds.

All the Michigan skunks awoke too,
and let me say something to you.

The freshly awoken skunk,
has go a rancid trunk.

They don’t even need to spray,
just crawling out flavors the day.

---

And Squirrels have been up to no good,
goodness know where they get all the food.

But they are large, to say the least,
the Michigan Squirrel is a beast.

---

I was happy to see the sparrows hopping around,
they were pecking something on the ground.

Though I met them third,
they were my childhood’s favorite bird.

The wise crows and pigeons are here too,
though preferring to avoid all this whooptiedo.

---

The announcement was heralded in by two geese,
who sung so loud that some called the police.

But they were just cheerful to be back,
to them Michigan is one huge snack.

Michiganders always give geese healthy food,
and they treat them really good.

We all love when the the need to cross the road,
especially when it is by the boatload.

It is like waiting for the train to pass,
except that our gees are badass.
