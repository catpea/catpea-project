JavaScript Is Cute And Flexible
Monday • January 6th 2025 • 11:23:11 pm

I came to JavaScript from many languages,
ASP, Perl, PHP, ActionScript, VisualBasic and Java to name a few.

It was still a slow web-browser language when I started learning it,
and I used Perl/PHP on the server.

So, I was using two programming languages,
one for the web browser user interface and one for the server.

While I programmed some stuff on my phone with Mozilla Rhino,
an interval timer for my early body building training.

It wasn’t until node.js came out,
that I switched to JavaScript completely.

Node.js, bun, and deno are server-side [JavaScript Runtimes][1],
that allow for JavaScript on both ends, server and browser.

Node.js was followed by Electron and nw.js, a stripped down browser,
as a cross-platform runtime for Desktop Applications.

If you learn JavaScript,
you will be able to program browsers and browser extensions.

Server-side code, where you can write your own HTTP servers,
or reuse interesting projects like Node-RED or ParseServer.

And write command line utilities,
that can be compiled to stand-alone executables.

Cross-platform Desktop Applications,
which package both server and browser in one, giving you full control.

And phone apps with ReactNative, NativeScript,
and Apache Cordova.

This is a broad and powerful OpenSource mix,
with any large points of failure.

Artificial Intelligence has as recently as couple of months,
improved so much, that is largely does help you write hard JavaScript.

I was just working on a command line parser,
and I set everything up for along session of coding.

And before really getting into it, I asked AI to do it for me,
and it did, it created a correct command line parser for my application.

You will never get stuck with AI helping you,
it is an incredible invitation into the world of programming.

Nothing like this has ever occurred before,
you have the kingdom and the keys.
