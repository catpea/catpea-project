Humanity can only grow by looking into its heart,

and slowly learning Philosophy, Sciences, and Art.

It is easy.

It is what the modern non-fiction is all about,

just, grab an audio book and go all out.

Hey, you don't need any reasons,

to become a connoisseur of the Seasons!

---

In Autumn, only read about Mother Nature,

and modern Adventure.

In Winter, focus on Philosophy and Art,

so that come spring you are always chipper and smart.

In Spring, you must absolutely read about Inner Strength,

mostly memoirs just to see how a human can go to great length.

In Summer, read or listen about our History,

how countless great beings fought for Unity, Wisdom and Glory.

The world is worthy of our love,

we should each transcend out limits, high and above.

We must all reach for knowledge and wisdom and awake,

forget leaders we can't ever know if they are true or fake.

We are one family, one world, one nation,

and the only thing dividing us is lack of education.

---

It is really hard to see,

how powerful Knowledge and Wisdom can be.

Maybe, think of it as knowledge received,

from lives you have not lived.

---

Once we all take to wisdom, real education will become first,

then we'll unite, and take down all the nuclear missiles that have us cursed.

Only then will we know,

how far is humanity able to go.
