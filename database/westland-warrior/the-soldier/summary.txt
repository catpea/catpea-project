The Soldier

## Zeno of Citium

![Zeno of Citium](files/zeno-of-citium.jpg)

[Zeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium) was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.

According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for\
humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not\
allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear\
of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part\
in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and\
justly.

Stoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier.

## Marcus Aurelius

Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the\
vanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius wrote\
a book titled [Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations) and today it is available as an\
[Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Meditations-Audiobook/B004IBRMZS).

## Tomoe Gozen

[Tomoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen) (c. 1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.

## Great Strength

Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almost\
optional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into\
retirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.

It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we find\
hard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn't a soldier that\
does not ask "Why am I in hell?".

...ldiers. War is Evil,\
War is Hell.

I think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson's words *Our\
humanity depends on everyone's humanity.*

We are one family, one people, there is no "them". It is just you, and me.

All cultures must leave bad ideas behind, and converge on wisdom.

Prevention.

## Hope

![Hope](files/lady.png)

I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war would\
spread to no end in time. That, Knightly Virtues, Chivalry, Bushido,\
Stoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would never stop\
making us better and wiser. But even a [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) has limitations, the gaps\
in schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and poverty\
will return.

## Poverty

Poverty, Never Changes.

Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying\
"I have kids, I need to put food on the table".

And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that "A human being is\
more than the worst thing they have ever done."

There is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment. Some\
are an emergent property of poverty. Maximization of survival, leads to the\
emergence of a self taught soldier.

## Hope

My friends, my heroes. The situation is only hopeless when we stand on the\
very bottom. When we rise, when we rise onto the shoulders of giants,\
things change.

The Hopelessness of Poverty becomes transformed into a Hope. It becomes yet\
another mission, a new challenge. It becomes a source of wisdom, a source\
of Great Power.

## Prevention

Humanity. Dignity. Knowledge. Wisdom. Foresight. Convergence. Peace.

## We Need You

**The Timeless & Unbreakable Family of Great Beings needs you.**

Hopes for you.

And the future generations, will need your shoulders to stand on.

Rise to the challenge, become part of the thousands of years of hope, hope\
for Peace, World Peace.

Confident, and Unafraid.
