The Bodybuilder

## Bodybuilding

Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or\
Happiness, or Success, it will ensue from pursuit of things that seem just\
out of your reach.

## The Big Three

The workout consists of three complementary exercises arranged in a way\
that I don’t have to stop.

1.  [Dumbbell Lateral Raise](https://youtu.be/FeJP4E4Z-PY?t=121)
2.  [Standing Dumbbell Curls](https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs)
3.  [Overhead Shoulder Press](https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153)

Combined with dancing, which in this context is a form of stretching that\
doubles as a cardio workout.

Good examples of fine workout songs are [Blade’s Blood Rave](https://youtu.be/F6VJQZxeWNY) for fast\
cardio and [Blanco Brown’s The Git Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7U6AoZ27yE) for rest and some stretching.

I find it really helpful to add sugar to my workout water, but I am sure\
candy works just as well. Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and\
good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine.

In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into some\
routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from [Standing\
Dumbbell Curls](https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs) to [Overhead Shoulder Press](https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153) where your biceps rest\
while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you\
use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. **If you need to stop\
then your weights are too heavy**, and your workout is not working out.

Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with 3.5lb\
per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you\
always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start.

## Hit Every Beat

There is no struggle because of music, the parts of your brain that are\
telling you to stop are weak. They are weaker than the beat of drums, they\
are weaker than a pretty song.

Workout to the beats of songs, here is a player I eventually settled on:\
[Professional MP3 HIFI Music Player](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32980109852.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.4efc7ec7pkt8Ur\&algo_pvid=121e3087-e613-4d...

## Of Focus and Trance

The staying in the moment that he describes can be induced with a fun and snappy playlist, where non-stop endurance bodybuilding is concerned.\
Ultra-marathons are different from endurance workouts, they take longer and you certainly don’t want to depend on your mp3 player to finish.\
At the same time ultra-marathons have relative silence and it is easier to focus in the middle of an interesting run.

## Trainer Song

I also created an Open Source (Free) workout instruction drum song, the mp3\
files are available here:\
