## Live Deliberately

I beg the youngest of you, to arrange your life in such a way so that each\
challenge before you, is the hardest thing you have ever done.

To paraphrase Thoreau: I beg you to live and grow up deliberately, to front\
only the essential facts of life, to see what love of wisdom has to teach,\
and not, when it comes to die, discover that you, my dear friend, had. not.\
yet. lived.

Life is not random, it is not an accident, you are an emergent plateau in\
an infinity of time ahead. You are needed, and your lasting contributions\
are necessary.

## Growing Up

Humanity must break away from the circles. Progress in the larger world,\
begins with you, at home, right now. Just the moment you say, “I am not\
smart enough”, “I am not a hero”, “I will never be heard”, “I will never be\
enough”, “Too Scary!”. That is how every hero begun, by measuring up; and\
then by growing up to the challenges before us.

## New Voices

The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://librivox.org/the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-by-the-united-nations/) needs work, each generation\
needs to update it and extend it beyond what it is today, grant it new\
voices - and there are bright new voices to be heard.

## Never Silenced

And there are voices that never stopped, fell out of the modern spotlight,\
but were never silenced, and never tired. No more circles.

## The Challenge

Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander\
put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many\
more things right.

In great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your\
children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the\
wall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up\
high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,\
is not optional.

My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is\
null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal\
Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and\
void. We are one family, one people.

I ask you to build homes with the belief that [the inherent dignity and\
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the\
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html), because\
our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity.

## The Hero and The Runaway

![The Hero and The Runaway](files/the-runaway.jpg)

We'll put things right, we'll fix it all.

## Heroism

Don’t be frightened of becoming a hero. It is always the longest possible\
way there, and it is always on the shoulders of giants, my friends.

By rising to the challenge, you become part of the family of great heroes,\
of great beings. You see, the adults are not going to run the world\
forever, by the time you become an adult, they are going to retire.

The job will belong to you. Break out of the circles, and aim up, all the\
way up.

All the bad ideas must be left behind, and all the good ideas put in one\
place where we can each share in them, where every member of the human\
family can Converge on Wisdom.

## World Crisis

The human family is not divided by political borders. Kandice’s kids aren’t\
the only kids that need help. This is not just a national crisis, it is a\
global one.
