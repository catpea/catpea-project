## JavaScript

The reason I mention JavaScript is because it is the most widely used\
programming language on github. [Searching for projects with more than\
10,000 stars](https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E%3D10000) shows 409 JavaScript based projects, the next one down is\
Python with 117.

## Svelte

A bright new JavaScript compiler/framework named [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (28.2k github\
stars) has recently entered the battle area.

Previously [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (154k stars) outcompeted Facebook's [React](https://reactjs.org/) (141k\
stars).

Svelte injects its code into your programs, whereas Vue.js and React ask\
you to program their way, learning new functions and strategies.

Svelte offers a [framework for building web applications](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), and an\
[approach to building mobile apps](https://svelte-native.technology/) as well.

If you are going to start programming, start with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

They offer a fantastic live coding tutorial at\
