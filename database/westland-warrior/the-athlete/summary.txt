The Athlete
Tuesday • October 1st 2019 • 10:34:29 pm

Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I
thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under
the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And
yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the
scroll. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.

Woods]() was made into a movie (comedy) where Bill Bryson is played by
