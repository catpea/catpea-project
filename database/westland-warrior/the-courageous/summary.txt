## Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett

![Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett](files/courage-calls.jpg)

English political leader, activist, writer and feminist icon. Known as a\
campaigner for women's suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until\
1919 she led Britain's largest women's rights organisation, the National\
Union of Women's Suffrage Societies.

## The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.

Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop,\
and often block traffic.

If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want\
to do their job, go home, and get paid.

If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw\
you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job\
and go watch some TV.

You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they'll just tag you as "Gifted"\
and you'll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you'll struggle to remember where\
it all started and what the battle was for.

## Because The Battle Is Not For You

The battle is for those that come; after you.

In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the\
end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the\
same.

In long term, you help the world grow, it won't be your world, it will be\
the world of the future.

The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education\
are two separate things.

It will make you tired.

## Bad News

There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you\
realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too\
low.

Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education,\
the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some "good"\
grades, making your parents happy.

Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up\
excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never\
looking back.

Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

structured subset of English.

You can write you entire program in BDD, and coordinate your team at the\
same time.

In the world of computers, teams can be distributed across the entire\
world. Some teams, can have revolving doors. And sometimes you may not even\
need doors, as you can post a BDD Test Issue on [Bounty Source](https://www.bountysource.com/) or\
