## Great Battle

Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.

If you make a wrong move, **you will lose**, but gain wisdom for it, with\
each failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.

Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,\
and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cut\
the job, move on.

## What to Avoid

Below is the text from [Love building themes? Join the Theme Store\
community at Shopify](https://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines), where website themes sell for $180.

(If you think you can handle this, go for it! Though, please note that they\
are gently asking that you have a team, which could mean outsourcing, and a\
budget for bug fixing. The platform for managing your outsourced team would\
be [github](https://github.com/) and [slack](https://slack.com/), this is doable you could even experiment\
paying your developers via [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/))

Personally, I see that the posting below has too many restrictions. And if\
your theme won't average 10 sales per month, they'll throw it out.

I don't know what their relationship is with [leading web design\
frameworks](https://github.com/topics/css). I don't think they have a rational streamlined pipeline.\
Because, what they call bug fixing is a massive undertaking requiring\
[dozens of developers](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/graphs/contributors).

The most widely developed foundation for themes, after many years of\
development had [60 issues](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse/monthly) last month alone (November 2019).

## What to Avoid

Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have no\
plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to\
make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes\
available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for\
their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate\
designers and developers we can work with ...

...f WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.

Now remember [INSPINIA](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S) is sitting right on top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) so\
[all this development is going on in the back](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse) at no charge to [INSPINIA\
Developers](https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers). All they do is add more components, and keep up with the\
latest updates to the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) code base.

## Services Platform

The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,\
low-liability versions of [wrapbootstrap.com](https://wrapbootstrap.com), [themes.shopify.com](https://themes.shopify.com/),\
or even [shopify.com](https://shopify.com/) it self, and others that tickle your fancy in\
similar ways.

Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to\
wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense

*   that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2\
    Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales ([3rd party sellers earn\
    80%](https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/fee-structure)).

Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step\
above the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform\
like [wrapbootstrap.com](https://wrapbootstrap.com) or [themes.shopify.com](https://themes.shopify.com/) for a monthly\
membership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.

## Become a CEO

Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even\
about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;\
because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).

It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a\
Founder, a CEO.

You shouldn't think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for\
the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference\
between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an\
employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.
