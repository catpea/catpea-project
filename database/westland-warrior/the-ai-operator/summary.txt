Please note that AI Art, is infinite.

And please understand the AI does not dream those images up, YOU ARE MAKING THE AI DREAM.

You can't group it all under a single category. So as long as what you generate is beautiful, it is a perfectly valid product that will make someone's heart smile.

From a customer perspective generated art is almost always more intricate, and often much more beautiful, than manually created art.

Manually created artwork may take hundreds of hours and cost thousands of dollars, it may not be something that the average person can afford to pay for.

Intricate AI Art can be very beautiful. And from time to time, a machine will create something so stunning, that many people who have had no interest in art, will now attempt to purchase a piece for their wall.

We have entered a New Renascence, learn how to use the free and Open Source Stable Diffusion, and begin creating your art.
