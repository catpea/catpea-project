## Quote by Henry David Thoreau

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only\
> the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to\
> teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did\
> not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to\
> practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep\
> and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like\
> as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave\
> close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...
>
> \-- Henry David Thoreau - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry\_David\_Thoreau
