The Survivalist

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only
> the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to
> teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did
> not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to
> practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep
> and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like
> as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave
> close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...

> -- Henry David Thoreau -
