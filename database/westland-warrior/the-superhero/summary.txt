[The three secrets of resilient people by Lucy Hone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWH8N-BvhAw "Play Video")

## Quote by Lucy Hone

> "Number One: Resilient people get that \[terrible disasters do happen],\
> they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn't mean they actually\
> welcome it \[...] just that when the tough times come they seem to know\
> that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you\
> from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come."
>
> "Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing carefully where\
> they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising\
> situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can\
> change, and somehow accept the things that they can't."
>
> "Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good in\
> your world."
>
> "Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves "Is what I'm doing helping\
> or harming me?" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy."
>
> "Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?"

## Quo Vadis?

Please note that monitoring where each of your steps is taking you, whether\
it is good or bad for you, will help you navigate life and improve your\
decision making.

Quo Vadis? My friends.

## A Warrior in Training

Dan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a character,\
next to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short. Dan is someone who\
quite literally pulled him self up by his own shoe laces.

Here is [Way of the Peaceful Warrior Audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Way-of-the-Peaceful-Warrior-Audiobook/B002UZKKSU) narrated by the man\
himself. It was also made into a movie starring Nick Nolte as Soc.

## Sensei Lee

There is a similar theme in No retreat No surrender, where the boy calls\
upon Sensei Lee, to come an teach him.

## By Whatever Means

By whatever means necessary, risky, or imaginary, we have to keep going\
forward, up, up, and away, ...

...n, aiming to inspire\
and help the world grow. She discovered the absence of teachers early on,\
and immediately became an educator her self.

## The Culture of Great Beings

Don’t be scared to save the world. Mind is a Reflex Organ, Soc says, and he\
is right. We must be in charge of ourselves. We have to take out the trash.\
And, at night, when everything comes at you and wakes you up at 3:13am when\
you are not ready to fight back, you can always turn on an Audiobook by\
Bill Bryson, Carl Sagan, or the lovely Sarah Vowell. Night by night, the\
culture of great beings will add to your culture. On the shoulders of\
giants also means that come your Golden Age, there will be little heroes\
checking if you have risen high enough for them to stand on your shoulders.

## Rise!

Never give up, whatever your calling, never retreat, never surrender. And\
in the absence of teachers, you become the teacher. Sure, maybe [anything\
that can go wrong will go wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) but that’s just the next challenge,\
your next level up. An opportunity to stand even taller.

## Best of Your Life

Come morning, it does not matter how old you are, or how many times you\
failed already, the rest of your life is always ahead of you. **Make the\
rest of your life, the best of your life.**
