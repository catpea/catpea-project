Printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) for quicker prototyping

## Shapeways Laser Printing

![Shapeways Laser Printing](files/shapeways.png)

[Sell](https://www.shapeways.com/marketplace) your 3D models through Printing on Demand (POD, printing only when someone pays for your product) at [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/) and similar 3d print shops. Shapeways created [shapejs](https://shapejs.shapeways.com/) a programmable product creator with many [examples in JavaScript](https://shapejs.shapeways.com/v2/examples), this can be used to generate a large number of unique products (antique coin pendants, tiny statues of art in public domain, odd bobble heads, skeleton wallets, waveform rings, UPC/QR code bracelets or keychain doodads.).

## Scanned Model Sales

![Scanned Model Sales](files/3dscan.png)

You are not limited to digital models, you can experiment with [3d\
scanners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_scanning) as well. Take a look at the [Shapeways Marketplace](https://www.shapeways.com/marketplace) for\
more ideas.
