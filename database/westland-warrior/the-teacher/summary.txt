## Knowledge vs. College

I think, he started learning the most valuable of his lessons, once he\
broke out oh the Grade Point Average Prison.

He selected courses that matched the wisdom he already had, he selected\
compatible knowledge he was naturally predisposed to integrate.

## Waiting For a Generation of Superheroes

Waiting For You.

And everybody else, to grow up, all the way up, until we become a\
generation after a generation of great beings.

Growing up is not optional. Growing all the way up, is not optional.

It is our Health, it is our Right.

It is the only way to break out, and bring about our hopes and dreams of\
the future.

## Waiting For the Champions

"It is hard to teach kids who stink."

We must face the misjudgment of the role of poverty in education.

We must face the misjudgment of the the gravity of poverty.

We must face policy that do...

----- snip ----- (Sorry, 5,000 letter limit in summaries see catpea.com or visit https://github.com/catpea/ for source-code) ----- snip -----

...tible knowledge on someone, and blame them for not\
integrating it, is evil.

If you are young and still in school. Begin making unbreakable promises\
that you will fix what is broken. Help your friends to Audio Books that set\
them free to understand Science, or travel the Appalachian Trail when\
waiting for the bus. Help them understand YCombinator and Techstars,\
Startup Accelerators, Angel Funds.

And if you have already left it all behind, now it is time to remember your\
hopes and dreams. Go back with your wisdom of today, and fix what was\
broken when you were little. Stand up in the classroom and rage against\
mediocrity or lies. Take a lesson from Erica Goldson.

[Erica Goldson Valedictorian Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts "Play Video")

## Mothers. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

"Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kindling of a flame."

The cradle of education is within. The flame of curiosity, lives within.\
Students reach out and put things into their soul, all the time.

Sometimes all it takes is a poem.

Sometimes the explanation, that all education is really for, is beating\
back Poverty of Mind-and-Wallet.

Poverty that they were unfortunately and unfairly dropped into, and now\
they must learn wisdom and fight their way out of, and if they so choose,\
bring back the light so that others may follow.

And later, finally, enjoy their existence and high achievement, leave a\
legacy worthy of following.

Never tell a child that life is not fair. That will only force them into\
accepting their poverty as a given, and your mediocrity as a fact.

Education is never! for good grades, or a good resume, or a good job that\
pays well.

Education is for the opposite of Memorization and Servitude.

Education is for Creativity, and Freedom.

Education is for Originality, and Independence.

Education is for Unbrekability, and Leadership.

The children you taught to wait for Superman, are, that promise, and the\
future, and more.

And the opposite of high achievement is not failing while daring greatly.\
Failure is nonsense, just another excuse not to try. There is no such thing\
as failure. Every step forward adds to success.
