## Problems with non Cut & Sew

![Problems with non Cut & Sew](files/dyesub0.jpg)

Below is a picture of why you must choose the Cut & Sew method. The\
printing process on pre-made garments is flawed, the gas will not permeate\
wrinkles that are sure to occur on pre-made garments. You must first create\
the fabric, and then Cut & Sew the garment. Take a look at the [source\
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQdPP04qEwU) that demonstrates the problem with sublimating pre-made garments\
in a bit more detail.
