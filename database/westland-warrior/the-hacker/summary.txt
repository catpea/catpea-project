## Raspberry Pi

The $35 [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is the most handsome in a class of computers\
called [Single-board computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer). They just released version 4, **so make\
sure you get that one**; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the\
PI, packaged in the [Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rcNjgVgc-I). Personally, I think\
getting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan of\
the plastic case and would go for a cool looking [Heat Sink “Case”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD568FB/ref=twister_B07VD58LGV?_encoding=UTF8\&psc=1) -\
and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two\
part review of all the popular cases here you go: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTlB6oju5w) and [Part\
2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYb2IEsfhnE). Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British\
phrases.

## Monitors

There is a class of monitors called [Portable Monitors](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps\&field-keywords=+Portable+Monitors) it is still nice\
to have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one to get; get a\
portable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can take it to\
Starbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and headphones; and\
[compose some music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfa9hGJzoY) with [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) whilst [pondering album art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mgrY-U9_8E) with\
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

## Screen Projector

![Screen Projector](files/screen-projector.jpg)

Don't forget about [Projectors](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps\&field-keywords=projectors) as those too are a kind of monitor (the\
cheap ones a...

The glider comes from [Conway’s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) the little things\
manufactured by [Gospers glider gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_\(cellular_automaton\)) and walking off towards lower right\
are gliders in action.)

## Game of Life and the Gliders

## Cellular Automaton

Gliders, are of the world of [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), you have heard Murray\
Gell-Mann talk about it in context of [Emergence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONiWmzrmfuY) the Game of Life is a\
little simulation of playing with Fundamental Principles, and Accidents.\
Life emerged the same way the gliders do, out of Complexity, Infinity of\
Time, Fundamental Principles, and Accidents (remember nobody counted the\
failed attempts).

## Stephen Wolfram

Here is Stephen Wolfram in his “Computing a theory of everything” TED talk,\
reminding us to **never pause** after uttering the words “I invented a new\
kind of science” - Oof!.

## White Hat Hackers

Without Pentesters, Ethical Hacking, or White Hat Hackers we would never\
become aware of vulnerabilities in our phones, smart homes, refrigerators,\
lockers - day to day lives. They do not keep information secret, and help\
us keep our family, homes, and possessions safer and more secure.
