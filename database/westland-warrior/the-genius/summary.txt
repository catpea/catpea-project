The Genius
Wednesday • April 1st 2020 • 12:22:10 am

## You are a Genius.

Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks.

One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The\
English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication.

The "Double U", the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet\
has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the\
comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde?

Rhymes.

Poems.

Songs.

Letters.

Essays.

Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades,\
parents?

Memorizing Poems?

Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did.

Speaking. Reading. Writing.

## Frameworks are superpowers, and your powers will call to you.

Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like\
Storytelling, for example.

You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings,\
now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and\
Faster Than Light Travel.

You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted\
objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on\
a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark\
forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it\
alive across centuries even as English evolves.

## Land of Monsters?

My friends, the story of [Grendles Mōdor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel%27s_mother "Grendel's Mother") remains unfinished, [Ides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idis_\(Germanic\))\
Aglæcwif of Ælwihta Eard; beacons her side to be writ. Was Grendles Modor a\
monster, would she be an Ide then?

Was the Dragon a mere reminder, a clumsy blurb for [Memento Mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori) or is\
that just the introduction to the real story, the story that has little to\
do with men like Beowulf who can't even take down a fat flying lizard\
right. A story burned to the ground by the spirit of the age, the Greatest\
Story Never Told, The Story of The Ides of the Old World.

Pick up the pen. Rebuild the story a thousand times, and let the version\
1001 earn you a place in history.

... way you\
did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken\
advantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school\
qualifying for more funding.

GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will\
easily mislead you. One example is [Vaccine Hesitancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy) which a lot of\
people fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls like\
[CFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion) and [Tetraethyl Lead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE2uwBA3EAw), and now [PFAS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22116696). You need to be\
knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the\
world.

Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don't\
count on the adults, they're all going to retire of old age soon enough.

Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on\
everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole\
World.

The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you\
will become the future.

Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way.

You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books.

Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot.

## The Future, The World

You were born a Genius. You are a Genius. It is not even that big of a\
deal, you are a human with a brain, Genius is what we do. On the other end,\
people saying they are better than you because they are a Genius, are sick\
from poverty of mind, they got fractured, stuck. It is sad, let us hope\
they feel better and catch up, but pass them on as they heal.

Keep moving forward, keep learning, the World needs you to grow, to grow\
all the way up, you, and all your peers, and all generations to come.

It is the journey of self education that makes the real difference.

Begin your journey under the banner of Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence\
and Love of Wisdom.

The Future, and The World, it will all be Yours.

You are far more than Genius.

Unbreakable.

Unstoppable.

Uncontainable.

Unpredictable.

Uncontrollable.

You Are The Future.
