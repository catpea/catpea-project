## Quote by Robert Ardrey

> But we were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides.
>
> And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles,\
> and our irreconcilable regiments?
>
> Or our treaties whatever they may be worth;\
> our symphonies however seldom they may be played;\
> our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields;\
> our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.
>
> The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen.
>
> We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses.
>
