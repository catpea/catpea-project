## Quote by Brené Brown

> ... So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am\
> I going to call this research?
>
> And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted"
>
> These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.
>
> So I started looking at the data, and here's what I found:
>
> What they had in common was a sense of courage.
>
> Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the\
> English language -- it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- and\
> the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your\
> whole heart.
