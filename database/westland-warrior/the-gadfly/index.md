### Ludwig Wittgenstein

[The meaning of this world — from "Wittgenstein" (He is talking about the peaceful culture of the future, about our eventual convergence on wisdom.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgNfx_PyGrI "Play Video")

"The limits of my language are the limits of my world" - said he.

[Wittgenstein Ludwig at a Cambridge class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdutZhUQIE "Play Video")

Read that as "All the things I talk about, are within the limits of the slice of the world that I was born and grew into."

I think, he is talking about formation of small cults, or endless groups of people sharing incompatible concepts, to mutually reinforce bonds.

But there is a super-culture, the unity that we all agree on. It is a culture of the future, where we all in wisdom and greatness abandon bad ideas, and converge on world peace, and endless self betterment.

Thank you Mr. Wittgenstein, we'll eventually create what you were once looking for.
