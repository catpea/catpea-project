The Hyperrealist

Digital painting in Krita, with or without the reference image stretched over canvas, will have you memorize eye structure in 3 sessions across a week or two. Memorization will occur automatically as you practice your portraits.



























Always take your own photo, and have permission from the model. Works that violate copyright and trademarks, cannot be sold, and everything else is gray-area that is not worth exploring.











Note how in videos above step one is creation of the subject, then photo-shoot, then painting. You need to build your scene first, and take your own photos, and then get to painting.
