## By Subtle Analogy

I have once discovered a poem that cradled the very definition of Wisdom.\
It simply said:

## Quote by Walt Whitman

> Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by\
> subtle analogies all other theories,
>
> The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;
>
> \-- Walt Whitman - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt\_Whitman
