The Poet
Tuesday • December 3rd 2019 • 8:39:49 pm

I have once discovered a poem that cradled the very definition of Wisdom.
It simply said:

> Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by
> subtle analogies all other theories,
> 
> The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;
> 
> -- Walt Whitman -





> I sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world.
> 
> -- Walt Whitman -





Do not forget that you are full of poems, that those who are walking near
your footsteps, need.

Become a Great Being.
